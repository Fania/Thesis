abstract = {The theory of creativity and exploratory search developed by Simon, March, and their followers in the Carnegie school relies on a coolly cognitive account of motivation. We argue that a more robust theory would give affect greater prominence. Our approach is inspired by Dewey’s (2002 Human Nature and Conduct. Prometheus: Amherst, MA) analysis of the three components of human conduct—habit, intelligence, and impulse, where impulse is Dewey’s term for affect. The Carnegie approach incorporates the first two, but has little to say about the third. We review literature on affect in psychology, psychodynamics, and neurobiology, showing how it allows us to characterize more effectively the motivational underpinnings of individual creativity and collective creative projects. This in turn enables us to sketch the key role of affect in exploratory search as compared to other domains of organizational activity.},

abstract = {Sounding Underground is an online interactive sonic environment that links sound excerpts from the metros of London, Paris and Mexico City, as selected by com- muters, as meaningful moments of sound from their commuting routine. Designed as a navigation structure, the environment draws on identifiable architectonic spaces such as entrances and corridors, but also incor- porates more abstract ‘spaces’ based on memorable sounds that passengers had in common. The creation of the environment focused on the perception of social, political and symbolic experiences, and was derived from an iterative ethnographic and artistic prac- tice which involved self-reflection, interviews, record- ings of and listening to the journeys, and commuters’ selections of sounds. This article describes the process of creation through the abstraction of a physical space, as well as the responses the work has evoked in the users and the academic community. It exemplifies the transdisciplinary nature of practice-based research involving the creative use of digital technologies.},

abstract = {This book aims at providing a thorough and updated introduction to the key Information Retrieval (IR) concepts and technologies behind search engines. In the modern online world, seeking and finding information of value is of paramount importance and, for this, people often refer to search engines because of their inherent effectiveness and simplicity. Search engines work because they are anchored on the field of IR – the primary goal of an IR system is to retrieve all the documents that are relevant to a user information query, while retrieving as few non-relevant documents as possible. This ambitious view of the problem naturally leads to a wealth of concepts and technologies, which are required to implement the search box paradigm. From parsing to indexing, clustering to classification, retrieval to ranking, and user feedback to retrieval evaluation, all of the most important concepts are carefully introduced and exemplified. The contents and structure of the book have been carefully designed by the two main authors, and the contributions of Eric Brown, Carlos Castillo, Marcos Gon\c{c}alves, David Hawking, Marti Hearst, Mounia Lalmas, Yoelle Maarek, Christian Middleton, Gonzalo Navarro, Dulce Poncele\'{o}n, Edie Rasmussen, Malcolm Slaney, and Nivio Ziviani greatly enrich the text with individual expertise from leaders in the field. This completely reorganized, revised and enlarged second edition of Modern Information Retrieval contains four new chapters and double the number of pages and bibliographic references of the first edition, and a companion website with teaching material. It will prove invaluable to students, professors, researchers, practitioners, and scholars of this fascinating field of IR},

abstract = {This paper explores the use of social annotations to improve web search. Nowadays, many services, e.g. del.icio.us, have been developed for web users to organize and share their favorite web pages on line by using social annotations. We observe that the social annotations can benefit web search in two aspects: 1) the annotations are usually good summaries of corresponding web pages; 2) the count of annotations indicates the popularity of web pages. Two novel algorithms are proposed to incorporate the above information into page ranking: 1) SocialSimRank (SSR) calculates the similarity between social annotations and web queries; 2) SocialPageRank (SPR) captures the popularity of web pages. Preliminary experimental results show that SSR can find the latent semantic association between queries and annotations, while SPR successfully measures the quality (popularity) of a web page from the web users’ perspective. We further evaluate the proposed methods empirically with 50 manually constructed queries and 3000 auto-generated queries on a dataset crawled from del.icio.us. Experiments show that both SSR and SPR benefit web search significantly.},

Leaving aside the artificial intelligence problem of training machines to behave like people, the Semantic Web approach instead develops languages for expressing information in a machine processable form. This document gives a road map - a sequence for the incremental introduction of technology to take us, step by step, from the Web of today to a Web in which machine reasoning will be ubiquitous and devastatingly powerful.

If the query is broad (i.e., it matches many documents) then the returned list is usually too long to view fully. Studies show that users usually look at only the top 10 to 20 results. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking scheme for broad queries that places the most authoritative pages on the query topic at the top of the ranking. Our algorithm operates on a special index of "expert documents." These are a subset of the pages on the WWW identified as directories of links to non-affiliated sources on specific topics. Results are ranked based on the match between the query and relevant descriptive text for hyperlinks on expert pages pointing to a given result page. We present a prototype search engine that implements our ranking scheme and discuss its performance. With a relatively small (2.5 million page) expert index, our algorithm was able to perform comparably on broad queries with the best of the mainstream search engines.},

Computers and creativity make interesting partners with respect to two different projects. One, which interests me the most, is understanding human creativity. The other is trying to produce machine creativity – or rather machine ‘creativity’ – in which the computer at least appears to be creative to some degree.},

abstract = {'Pataphysics, what Alfred Jarry calls "the science of imaginary solutions", has until now gone largely ignored by literary scholars, due in part to its academic frivolity and hermetic perversity. Nevertheless, this capricious philosophy has inspired nearly one hundred years of avant-garde experimentation. Christian Bok redresses this critical omission by tracing the tangled history of 'pataphysics, discussing the tension between science and poetics, in order to demonstrate that 'pataphysics constitutes an intrinsic, but neglected, cornerstone of postmodernity itself.Bok examines the work of Jarry, arguing that it represents a humorous addendum to the philosophy of Nietzsche, while also considering the influence of 'pataphysics upon the poetic legacy of the twentieth century, particularly the work of Italian Futurists, French Oulipians, and Canadian Jarryites. Bok resorts to the radical poetics of such contemporary philosophers as Deleuze, Derrida, Baudrillard, and Serres in order to explicate the 'pataphysical relationship between rationalism and its discontents.Bok draws on a wide range of reading in poetry and theory to establish a firm historical ground for understanding the influence of 'pataphysics -- all the while making a variety of seemingly difficult or obscure material accessible in a surprisingly charming and poetic manner.A long overdue critical look at a significant strain of the twentieth-century avant-garde, his book raises important historical, cultural, and theoretical issues germane to the production and reception of poetry, how we think about it, how we read it, how we read it, and what sorts of claims it makes upon our understanding.},

abstract = {Semantic similarity measures play important roles in infor- mation retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Previ- ous work in semantic web-related applications such as com- munity mining, relation extraction, automatic meta data extraction have used various semantic similarity measures. Despite the usefulness of semantic similarity measures in these applications, robustly measuring semantic similarity between two words (or entities) remains a challenging task. We propose a robust semantic similarity measure that uses the information available on the Web to measure similarity between words or entities. The proposed method exploits page counts and text snippets returned by a Web search engine. We define various similarity scores for two given words P and Q, using the page counts for the queries P, Q and P AND Q. Moreover, we propose a novel approach to compute semantic similarity using automatically extracted lexico-syntactic patterns from text snippets. These different similarity scores are integrated using support vector ma- chines, to leverage a robust semantic similarity measure. Experimental results on Miller-Charles benchmark dataset show that the proposed measure outperforms all the existing web-based semantic similarity measures by a wide margin, achieving a correlation coefficient of 0.834. Moreover, the proposed semantic similarity measure significantly improves the accuracy (F-measure of 0.78) in a community mining task, and in an entity disambiguation task, thereby verifying the capability of the proposed measure to capture semantic similarity using web content.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/. To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

Ours is an era in which the humanities have the potential to play a vastly expanded creative role in public life. The present volume puts itself forward in support of a Digital Humanities that asks what it means to be a human being in the networked information age and to participate in fluid communities of practice, asking and answering research questions that cannot be reduced to a single genre, medium, discipline, or institution. Digital Humanities represents a major expansion of the purview of the humanities, precisely because it brings the values, representational and interpretive practices, meaning-making strategies, complexities, and ambiguities of being human into every realm of experience and knowledge of the world. It is a global, trans-historical, and transmedia approach to knowledge and meaning-making.},

abstract = {The De Montfort Creativity Assistant provides several facilities enabling people to collaborate on differ- ent projects. Hence, the never-ending input of data requires powerful techniques for identification and structure. Current Information Retrieval systems lack of data models and methods which can cater for freshness, incompleteness, imprecision, inconsistency and trustfulness. As a result, current systems are not able to handle data from various sources on a sufficient manner. The research on this project will lead to a system which is designed for the internet domain and the resultant diversity of information. Identification of techniques for processing data from heterogeneous sources, satisfying the idea of transliteracy will be an essential part of the research. The De Montfort Creativity Assistant, as a Web 2.0 compliant framework, will benefit from a powerful and flexible data preprocessing unit. The identification and storage of all useful information as the main aim of the pre- processing step will enable further conditioning in type of knowledge mining. This report provides an introduction and the motivation of the information retrieval system for the De Montfort Creativity Assistant. Furthermore a problem statement explaining the requirement for further research on this topic. One section will give insight of the initial results, mainly the development of a first version of the De Montfort Creative Environment.

The approach is informed by studies arising from practice-based research, a form of research adopted by creative practitioners for whom the artifact, for example an artwork, is a central concern.

abstract = {With over 800 million pages covering most areas of human endeavor, the World-wide Web is a fertile ground for data mining research to make a difference to the effectiveness of information search. Today, Web surfers access the Web through two dominant interfaces: clicking on hyperlinks and searching via keyword queries. This process is often tenta- tive and unsatisfactory. Better support is needed for ex- pressing one's information ,heed and dealing with a search result in more structured ways than available now. Data mining and machine learning have significant roles to play towards this end. In this paper we will survey recent advances in learning and mining problems related to hypertext in general and the Web in particular. We will review the continuum of super- vised to semi-supervised to unsupervised learning problems, highlight the specific challenges which distinguish data min- ing in the hypertext domain from data mining in the context of data warehouses, and summarize the key areas of recent and ongoing research.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of the World-Wide Web poses unprecedented scaling challenges for general-purpose crawlers and search engines. In this paper we describe a new hypertext resource discovery system called a Focused Crawler. The goal of a focused crawler is to selectively seek out pages that are relevant to a pre-defined set of topics. The topics are specified not using keywords, but using exemplary documents. Rather than collecting and indexing all accessibleWeb documents to be able to answer all possible ad-hoc queries, a focused crawler analyzes its crawl boundary to find the links that are likely to be most relevant for the crawl, and avoids irrelevant regions of the Web. This leads to significant savings in hardware and network resources, and helps keep the crawl more up-to-date. To achieve such goal-directed crawling, we designed two hype},

Text classification algorithms were used to automatically classify arbitrary search results into an existing category structure on-the-fly. A user study compared our new category interface with the typical ranked list interface of search results. The study showed that the category interface is superior both in objective and subjective measures. Subjects liked the category interface much better than the list interface, and they were 50\% faster at finding information that was organized into categories. Organizing search results allows users to focus on items in categories of interest rather than having to browse through all the results sequentially.},

abstract = {As part of the ongoing Illinois Digital Library Initiative project, this research proposes an intelligent agent ap- proach to Web searching. In this experiment, we devel- oped two Web personal spiders based on best first search and genetic algorithm techniques, respectively. These personal spiders can dynamically take a user’s selected starting homepages and search for the most closely related homepages in the Web, based on the links and keyword indexing. A graphical, dynamic, Java- access. A system architecture for implementing such an agent-based spider is presented, followed by detailed discussions of benchmark testing and user evaluation results. In benchmark testing, although the genetic algo- rithm spider did not outperform the best first search spi- der, we found both results to be comparable and com- plementary. In user evaluation, the genetic algorithm spi- der obtained significantly higher recall value than that of the best first search spider. However, their precision values were not statistically different. The mutation pro- cess introduced in genetic algorithm allows users to find other potential relevant homepages that cannot be ex- plored via a conventional local search process. In addi- tion, we found the Java-based interface to be a neces- sary component for design of a truly interactive and dy- namic Web agent.},

We describe this field via a working definition; a brief history of seminal work; an exploration of the main issues, technologies and ideas; and a look towards future directions. As a society, we are jealous of our creativity: creative people and their contributions to cultural progression are highly valued. Moreover, creative behaviour in people draws on a full set of intelligent abilities, so simulating such behaviour represents a serious technical challenge for Artificial Intelligence research. As such, we believe it is fair to characterise Computational Creativity as a frontier for AI research beyond all others—maybe, even, the final frontier.},

The aim of an IR system is to estimate the relevance of documents to users' information needs, expressed by means of a query. This is a very difficult and complex task, since it is pervaded with imprecision and uncertainty. Most of the existing IR systems offer a very simple model of IR, which privileges efficiency at the expense of effectiveness. A promising direction to increase the effectiveness of IR is to model the concept of "partially intrinsic" in the IR process and to make the systems adaptive, i.e. able to "learn" the user's concept of relevance. To this aim, the application of soft computing techniques can be of help to obtain greater flexibility in IR systems.},

The approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents ("semantic structure") in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed into a set of ca 100 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented by ca 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.},

Navigating such a Semantic Web on the Web is difficult due to the paucity of explicit hyperlinks beyond the namespaces in URIrefs and the few inter-document links like rdfs:seeAlso and owl:imports. In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Web navigation model providing additional navigation paths through Swoogle's search services such as the Ontology Dictionary. Using this model, we have developed algorithms for ranking the importance of Semantic Web objects at three levels of granularity: documents, terms and RDF graphs. Experiments show that Swoogle outperforms conventional web search engine and other ontology libraries in finding more ontologies, ranking their importance, and thus promoting the use and emergence of consensus ontologies.},

abstract = {Nearly a decade ago, Johanna Drucker cofounded the University of Virginia’s SpecLab, a digital humanities laboratory dedicated to risky projects with serious aims. In SpecLab she explores the implications of these radical efforts to use critical practices and aesthetic principles against the authority of technology based on analytic models of knowledge. Inspired by the imaginative frontiers of graphic arts and experimental literature and the technical possibilities of computation and information management, the projects Drucker engages range from Subjective Meteorology to Artists’ Books Online to the as yet unrealized ’Patacritical Demon, an interactive tool for exposing the structures that underlie our interpretations of text. Illuminating the kind of future such experiments could enable, SpecLab functions as more than a set of case studies at the intersection of computers and humanistic inquiry. It also exemplifies Drucker’s contention that humanists must play a role in designing models of knowledge for the digital age—models that will determine how our culture will function in years to come.},

Due to the explosive growth of the Web, the domain of Web personalization has gained great momentum both in the research and commercial areas. In this article we present a survey of the use of Web mining for Web personalization. More specifically, we introduce the modules that comprise a Web personalization system, emphasizing the Web usage mining module. A review of the most common methods that are used as well as technical issues that occur is given, along with a brief overview of the most popular tools and applications available from software vendors. Moreover, the most important research initiatives in the Web usage mining and personalization areas are presented.},

Rather than a technical account or retrospective, the aim is to demonstrate by example how research itself is a primary process, illus- trated by work carried out at the Institute of Creative Technologies (IOCT) during the last few years. When creative output is appraised only from its visible results, something is lost in the telling; carefully selected public facets rarely convey the depths of the underlying lines of inquiry. The research covered is for a work that generates quantitative data, driving visualisations of human movement, proximity and orientation. The aim is to reveal how these literal data reflect our relationships to one another in social settings. To contextualise the current process, complex systems, dynamic pattern formation and other works are also mentioned. As a per- sonal account, it seemed appropriate to supplement the usual academic passive voice with first-person narrative.},

In particular, the article concentrates on the encounter of Edmonds with artistic thinking about systems and process in the broad sense, as well as digital and interactive work developed from the early 1980s. As the article will demonstrate, a passion for colour, time and structure, the encounter with a number of artists inspired by Constructivism in the early 1980s, and the educational context in which Edmonds has worked from the late 1960s until the present, have offered great opportunities of interdisci- plinary exchanges and ideas that had a profound impact upon the nature of his art. These influences have enabled Edmonds to explore new constructs in art through the use of technology that are a constant stimulus in his creative research, both as an artist and as an academic.},

While human experts can identify spam, it is too expensive to manually evaluate a large number of pages. Instead, we propose tech- niques to semi-automatically separate reputable, good pages from spam. We first select a small set of seed pages to be evaluated by an expert. Once we manually identify the reputable seed pages, we use the link structure of the web to discover other pages that are likely to be good. In this paper we discuss possible ways to implement the seed selection and the discovery of good pages. We present results of experiments run on the World Wide Web indexed by AltaVista and evaluate the performance of our techniques. Our results show that we can effectively filter out spam from a sig- nificant fraction of the web, based on a good seed set of less than 200 sites.},

abstract = {What can happen if we combine the best ideas from the Social Web and Semantic Web? The Social Web is an ecosystem of participation, where value is created by the aggregation of many individual user contributions. The Semantic Web is an ecosystem of data, where value is created by the integration of structured data from many sources. What applications can best synthesize the strengths of these two approaches, to create a new level of value that is both rich with human participation and powered by well-structured information? This paper proposes a class of applications called collective knowledge systems, which unlock the "collective intelligence" of the Social Web with knowledge representation and reasoning techniques of the Semantic Web.},

Folksonomies are an emergent phenomenon of the Social Web. They arise from data about how people associate terms with content that they generate, share, or consume. Recently the two ideas have been put into opposition, as if they were right and left poles of a political spectrum. This is a false dichotomy; they are more like apples and oranges. In fact, as the Semantic Web matures and the Social Web grows, there is increasing value in applying Semantic Web technologies to the data of the Social Web. This article is an attempt to clarify the distinct roles for ontologies and folksonomies, and previews some new work that applies the two ideas together - an ontology of folksonomy.},

The article begins with a review of machinima as an example of digital creative practice, akin to mashup and remix genres. The nature of machinima is presented through interviews, providing an overview of its authen- ticity, roles of networks and communities of practice, transdisciplinary creative practice, transliteracy, trans- ferability and accessibility as a learning tool in develop- ing competency in digital creativity. It is suggested that machinima is ‘digital clay’ that has the potential to add value to practice-based learning in a connected world. The article concludes with a summary of the unique con- tributions that machinima gives the creative learning process.},

abstract = {The original PageRank algorithm for improving the ranking of search-query results computes a single vector, using the link structure of the Web, to capture the relative “importance” of Web pages, independent of any particular search query. To yield more accurate search results, we propose computing a set of PageRank vectors, biased using a set of representative topics, to capture more accurately the notion of importance with respect to a particular topic. For ordinary keyword search queries, we compute the topic- sensitive PageRank scores for pages satisfying the query using the topic of the query keywords. For searches done in context (e.g., when the search query is performed by highlighting words in a Web page), we compute the topic-sensitive PageRank scores using the topic of the context in which the query appeared. By using linear combinations of these (precomputed) biased PageRank vectors to generate context-specific importance scores for pages at query time, we show that we can generate more accurate rankings than with a single, generic PageRank vector. We describe techniques for efficiently implementing a large-scale search system based on the topic-sensitive PageRank scheme.},

@article{Heilman2003,
abstract = {This article reviews and develops some theories about the neurobiological basis of creative innovation (CI). CI is defined as the ability to understand and express novel orderly relationships. A high level of general intelligence, domain-specific knowledge and special skills are necessary components of creativity. Specialized knowledge is stored in specific portions of the temporal and parietal lobes. Some anatomic studies suggest that talented people might have alterations of specific regions of the posterior neocortical architecture, but further systematic studies are needed. Intelligence, knowledge and special skills, however, are not sufficient for CI. Developing alternative solutions or divergent thinking has been posited to be a critical element of CI, and clinical as well as functional imaging studies suggest that the frontal lobes are important for these activities. The frontal lobes have strong connections with the polymodal and supramodal regions of the temporal and parietal lobes where concepts and knowledge are stored. These connections might selectively inhibit and activate portions of posterior neocortex and thus be important for developing alternative solutions. Although extensive knowledge and divergent thinking together are critical for creativity they alone are insufficient for allowing a person to find the thread that unites. Finding this thread might require the binding of different forms of knowledge, stored in separate cortical modules that have not been previously associated. Thus, CI might require the co-activation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected. The observations that CI often occurs during levels of low arousal and that many people with depression are creative suggests that alterations of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine might be important in CI. High levels of norepinephrine, produced by high rates of locus coeruleus firing, restrict the breadth of concept representations and increase the signal to noise ratio, but low levels of norepinephrine shift the brain toward intrinsic neuronal activation with an increase in the size of distributed concept representations and co-activation across modular networks. In addition to being important in divergent thinking, the frontal lobes are also the primary cortical region that controls the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system. Thus creative people may be endowed with brains that are capable of storing extensive specialized knowledge in their temporoparietal cortex, be capable of frontal mediated divergent thinking and have a special ability to modulate the frontal lobe-locus coeruleus (norepinephrine) system, such that during creative innovation cerebral levels of norepinephrine diminish, leading to the discovery of novel orderly relationships.},

The enterprise is fraught with dangers. There is a risk of reduction: pataphysics is rich and complex, so anything that resembles a simplified “explanation” will fail to do it justice. Conversely, there is the problem of taking it all too seriously. Everybody knows that a joke explained is not a joke at all. Since pataphysics recognises no distinction between humour and seriousness there is always a possibility that any statement on the subject will end up pricking its own balloon. Worst of all, there is the fear of the disapproval of the worldwide community of pataphysicians,4 whose deep erudition and independence of mind make them supremely intolerant of any traduction of that which they hold so dear, even if it emanates from one of their own. In the face of these perils, one may well wonder why this book exists at all.},

Drawing on the experience of developing and running the Masters in Creative Tech- nologies (MA/MSc) at the Institute of Creative Tech- nologies at De Montfort University, Leicester, we explore a number of areas relating to transdisciplinary teaching and learning in higher education, including: how digital technologies enable students to work in a transdisciplinary manner; how working creatively with technology enables transdisciplinary modes of working; and the ways in which transdisciplinarity, enabled by digital technologies, has affected the creative practice of learners. The article discusses how the pro- gramme has developed a climate for creativity, and out- lines how the knowledge and skills gained during a creative technologies-related transdisciplinary pro- gramme meet the needs of a changing workplace.},

Pataphysics, the science of exceptions and imaginary solutions, can be directly linked to creativity and is therefore very suitable to guide the transformation from relevant into creative search results. To enable pataphysical algorithms within our system we propose the need for a new type of system architecture. We discuss a component-based software architecture that would allow the flexible integration of the new algo- rithms at any stage or location and the need for an index suitable to handle patadata, data which have been transformed pataphysically. This tool aims to gen- erate surprising, novel and provocative search results rather than relevant ones, in order to inspire a more crea- tive interaction that has applications in both creative work and learning contexts.},

We pro- pose a complementary approach, applicable in any domain with object-to-object relationships, that measures similar- ity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, we compute a measure that says “two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects.” This general similar- ity measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and in- tuitive graph-theoretic model. For a given domain, Sim- Rank can be combined with other domain-specific simi- larity measures. We suggest techniques for efficient com- putation of SimRank scores, and provide experimental re- sults on two application domains showing the computa- tional feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {This thesis proposes SPECS:a Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative Systems. No methodology has been accepted as standard for evaluating the creativity of a system in the field of computational creativity and the multi-faceted and subjective nature of creativity generates substantial definitional issues. Evaluative practice has developed a general lack of rigour and system- aticity, hindering research progress. SPECS is a standardised and systematic methodology for evaluating computational creativity. It is flexible enough to be applied to a variety of different types of creative system and adaptable to specific demands in different types of creativity. In the three-stage process of evaluation, researchers are required to be specific about what creativity entails in the domain they work in and what standards they test a system’s creativity by. To assist researchers, definitional issues are investigated and a set of components representing aspects of creativity is presented, which was empirically derived using computational linguistics analysis. These components are recommended for use within SPECS, being offered as a general definition of creativity that can be customised to account for any specific priorities for creativity in a given domain. SPECS is applied in a case study for detailed comparisons of the creativity of three musical im- provisation systems, identifying which systems are more creative than others and why. In a second case study, SPECS is used to capture initial impressions on the creativity of systems presented at a 2011 computational creativity research event. Five systems performing different creative tasks are compared and contrasted. These case studies exemplify the valuable information that can be obtained on a system’s strengths and weaknesses. SPECS gives researchers vital feedback for improving their systems’ creativity, informing further progress in computational creativity research.},

We had multiple aims: For the Web Track we wanted to compare the effective- ness of anchor text of the category A and B col- lections and the impact of global document qual- ity measures such as PageRank and spam scores. We find that documents in ClueWeb09 category B have a higher probability of being retrieved than other documents in category A. In ClueWeb09 cat- egory B, spam is mainly an issue for full-text re- trieval. Anchor text suffers little from spam. Spam scores can be used to filter spam but also to find key resources. Documents that are least likely to be spam tend to be high-quality results. For the Entity Ranking Track, we use Wikipedia as a pivot to find relevant entities on the Web. Us- ing category information to retrieve entities within Wikipedia leads to large improvements. Although we achieve large improvements over our baseline run that does not use category information, our best scores are still weak. Following the external links onWikipedia pages to find the homepages of the entities in the ClueWeb collection, works bet- ter than searching an anchor text index, and com- bining the external links with searching an anchor text index.},

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of contexts on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of “authoritative” information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of “hub pages” that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristics for link-based analysis.},

How- ever, there is a lot of confusions when comparing research efforts from different point of views. In this paper, we sur- vey the research in the area of Web mining, point out some confusions regarded the usage of the term Web mining and suggest threeWeb mining categories. Then we situate some of the research with respect to these three categories. We also explore the connection between the Web mining cate- gories and the related agent paradigm. For the survey, we focus on representation issues, on the process, on the learn- ing algorithm, and on the application of the recent works as the criteria.

Such data are routinely produced by sequence alignments, hybridization arrays, genome mapping, and genotyping studies. Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text. Bitmap or vector images can be created from GFF-style data inputs and hierarchical configuration files, which can be easily generated by automated tools, making Circos suitable for rapid deployment in data analysis and reporting pipelines.},

Therefore, a scalable approach to support Internet searching is critical to the success of Internet services. Actually Internet is a directed graph, webpage as node and hyperlink as edge, so the search operation could be abstracted as a process of traversing directed graph. This paper introduces a famous dynamic Web search algorithms, the "fish-search", and analyzes its merits contrasting to general depth-first algorithm, and points out that the random of search range could lead to repeated search or overlong search time. Based on the analysis of flocking behavior of fish school, a parameter "dist" is defined to control the search range and time. This paper presents an improved "fish-search" algorithm, in which the search process could adjust the search range adaptively. Simulation shows some improvements over the original fish-search algorithm.},

The expertise areas of the persons are represented by documentary evidence of expertise, known as candidate profiles. The statement of this research work is that the expert search task in an enterprise setting can be successfully and effectively modelled using a voting paradigm. In the so-called VotingModel, when a document is retrieved for a query, this document represents a vote for every expert associated with the document to have relevant expertise to the query topic. This voting paradigm is manifested by the proposition of various voting techniques that aggregate the votes from documents to candidate experts. Moreover, the research work demonstrates that these voting techniques can be modelled in terms of a Bayesian belief network, providing probabilistic semantics for the proposed voting paradigm.},

He discusses new media's reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database. Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media.},

However, when simply following links while seeking information, users may become disoriented and frustrated at their lack of ability to find specific or useful pieces of information. This is why the integration of information-retrieval techniques into such systems makes sense. The search for information can then be as well satisfied by specifying an information-retrieval query.},

abstract = {The Web today provides a massive amount of information for researchers. A major contributing factor to its success is the simplicity of publishing almost any type of data. Discovery, however, is much more inefficient, generally using a term-based paradigm that requires entering keywords into a search engine and browsing through results, refining the terms to improve the accuracy of the returns. The ranking algorithms used frequently show the most significant sites in terms of links but at the expense of obscuring the ‘long tail’ which may also contain valuable information. We are also hidden from the ‘Deep Web’ of resources either invisible to search engines or blocked through access controls. The reason systems cannot automatically crawl the web and index data of a particular type is that web pages are generally not ‘machine-readable’, i.e. the elements of information on a typical web page are not marked up with the conceptual nature of their content so a Natural Language Processing approach is the only feasible way of automatically parsing and comparing the text.},

Data that holds valuable information, and may provide us knowledge, but often is inaccessible because of its form and volume. Fortunately, new methods are emerging and evolving that enable us to create knowledge from data. Specifically, methods and tools that extract previously unknown information from aggregations of data. To name a few examples, patterns and relations can be revealed, clusters identified and predictions made. The application extends to many types of data: concepts and relations can be derived from large text collections, image and video collections can be analyzed for better access. This book gives an idea of the possibilities and expectations of data mining from five perspectives: Science - The role of data mining for science in general is discussed and many examples are given. Business and government - Starting from several common needs in these environments, over ten cases are presented illustrating present and future possibilities for data mining. Ethics, privacy and legislation - Ethical aspects of web mining, fair information practices and some general legal aspects are examined. The individual - From the perspective of the individual (one moment a knowledge worker, the next a private person) looking for an exciting scene in a sports match video a different view arises: text mining, web mining, image, video and music mining are the topics here. We also discuss the role of data mining in personal knowledge management. Technology and techniques - After a discussion on methodology and process embedding, we will zoom in on twenty knowledge discovery, data mining and analysis techniques, the basic building blocks enabling us to convert data into knowledge. The book is enhanced by a CD-rom, containing the full book text and many tutorials, reports, and papers both deepening and widening the view. All textual data is accessible through an integrated text mining tool. Many of the techniques from the technical part of this book can be explored through freeware and demo software included on the CD-rom.},

abstract = {While search engines have become the major decision support tools for the Internet, there is a growing disparity between the image of the World Wide Web stored in search engine repositories and the actual dynamic, distributed nature of Web data.We propose to attack this problem using an adaptive population of intelligent agents mining the Web online at query time. We discuss the benefits and shortcomings of using dynamic search strategies versus the traditional static methods in which search and retrieval are disjoint. This paper presents a public Web intelligence tool called MySpiders, a threaded multiagent system designed for information discovery. The performance of the system is evaluated by comparing its effectiveness in locating recent, relevant documents with that of search engines. We present results suggesting that augmenting search engines with adaptive populations of intelligent search agents can lead to a significant competitive advantage. We also discuss some of the challenges of evaluating such a system on currentWeb data, introduce three novel metrics for this purpose, and outline some of the lessons learned in the process.},

We show how the cluster label discovery can be accomplished with the use of the Latent Semantic Indexing technique. We also discuss several factors that influence the quality of cluster description, such as input data preprocessing and language identification. As part of this thesis we prepared an implementation of our algorithm within the framework of Carrot2. To evaluate the practical performance of our algorithm we propose an expert- based scheme for assessment of clustering results.},

The partnership between the University of Leicester and Simulacra worked with three UK museums to test the viability of building and sustaining such a system. The paper places the use of such dynamic 'labelling' in the longer historical context of museum interpretation and the relationship between museums' on-site and on-line channels. It considers the findings of both visitor observation and the impact of different 'generators' (authors) and 'triggers' (events) of the labels' live content. However, what is brought into particular relief is the range of assumptions made by the curators involved – assumptions with particular implications for the way both Web-based and gallery-based content and interpretation were seen to be valued within the respective institutions.},

In the perfectly interoperable, automatically-joined world of 'Web 3.0', some think we need our content connected more closely, more intelligently, with more meaning. But, faced with the initial challenges of Web 2.0, is the UK museum and gallery sector now heading in the right direction strategically, technically and in terms of sustainability? Is the negligible engagement of UK museums with the new wave Web an indicator of more fundamental blockages to come? Can we cope with even bigger steps towards a more unified digital world, an Internet of things? Many people working deep in the digital cultural sector feel there’s a growing gap between what’s going on out there in the fertile land of Facebook, and what’s going on in our arid world of collection descriptions, copyright conundrums and so on. A wish for more decisive, open-minded developmental connections recently led to the 2006/2007 Semantic Web Think Tank (SWTT) project, a UK research partnership between the Museums Computer Group, MDA, the V\&A, Natural History Museum, Science Museum, the 24 Hour Museum and collaborators in the academic world, such as Cambridge University, Leicester University and software sector groups like Box UK. The SWTT project pulled together experts from all sides, talking in six directed sessions which were recorded and published as papers on a blog and in a planned report. The big ‘take home’ from the SWTT project has not, in the end, been a demonstrator, mash-up or a software widget of some kind. It’s the emergence of a suggested roadmap for the development of a joined-up digital cultural sector, to be revealed in more detail in a report published spring/summer 2008.},

@book{Penrose1999,
abstract = {Roger Penrose, one of the world's top physicists, summarizes modern science, examining topics including Turing machines, relativity, quantum physics, black holes, etc. At the end, he argues that the human mind can not be simulated by computers or anything algorithmic. The Emperor's New Mind is my favorite book, although I didn't feel that way the first time I read it. It is quite technical, compared to, for instance, A Brief History of Time, which covers some of the same topics. The second time I read the book, I really dedicated a lot of time to understand the material as well as I could, often working out problems with paper and pencil. This was necessary for me to see that his conclusion was related to the rest of the book. While Penrose obviously can not "prove" his belief, he gives a strong, fascinating arguement, and the book has definitely affected my philosophical views concerning consciousness.},

abstract = {WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can be navigated with the browser. WordNet is also freely and publicly available for download. WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing. WordNet superficially resembles a thesaurus, in that it groups words together based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions. First, WordNet interlinks not just word forms—strings of letters—but specific senses of words. As a result, words that are found in close proximity to one another in the network are semantically disambiguated. Second, WordNet labels the semantic relations among words, whereas the groupings of words in a thesaurus does not follow any explicit pattern other than meaning similarity.},

The specially designed, standard corpora which underpin linguistic study are limited in the view of language use that they can provide, both in terms of size and of recentness, and the web is in principle freely available to provide supplementary and complementary data to fill the gaps. The first generation of web search tools, such as our ‘WebCorp’ system, has been dependent on commercial search engines to retrieve relevant text, a situation which has restricted the amount and type of information and the kinds of analysis and formatting which can be provided for the user. A second-generation web search tool, ‘WebCorpLSE’is being developed as a home-grown web search engine, tailored to bypass the obstacles presented by the non-language-geared and commercially-prioritised versions, and better serve the needs of researchers seeking evidence of particular language use on the web.},

We propose a formal (and rather simplified) outline of the relevant attributes of a potentially creative program. Based on this, we posit a number of formal criteria that could be applied to rate the extent to which the program has behaved creatively. A guiding principle is that the question of what computational mechanisms might lead to creative behaviour is open and empirical, and hence we should clearly distinguish between judgements about creative achievements and theoretical proposals about potentially creative mechanisms. The intention is to focus, clarify and make more concrete the debate about creative programs. 1},

Senses are interpreted as groups (or clusters) of similar contexts of the ambiguous word. Words, contexts, and senses are represented in Word Space, a high-dimensional, real-valued space in which closeness corresponds to semantic similarity. Similarity in Word Space is based on second-order co-occurrence: two tokens (or contexts) of the ambiguous word are assigned to the same sense cluster if the words they co-occur with in turn occur with similar words in a training corpus. The algorithm is automatic and unsupervised in both training and application: senses are induced from a corpus without labeled training instances or other external knowledge sources. The paper demonstrates good performance of context-group discrimination for a sample of natural and artificial ambiguous words.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an analysis of an AltaVista Search Engine query log consisting of approximately 1 billion en- tries for search requests over a period of six weeks. This represents almost 285 million user sessions, each an attempt to fill a single information need. We present an analysis of in- dividual queries, query duplication, and query sessions. We also present results of a correlation analysis of the log entries, studying the interaction of terms within queries. Our data supports the conjecture that web users differ significantly from the user assumed in the standard information retrieval literature. Specifically, we show that web users type in short queries, mostly look at the first 10 results only, and seldom modify the query. This suggests that traditional informa- tion retrieval techniques may not work well for answering web search requests. The correlation analysis showed that the most highly correlated items are constituents of phrases. This result indicates it may be useful for search engines to consider search terms as parts of phrases even if the user did not explicitly specify them as such.},

abstract = {This thesis describes EM-ONE, an architecture for commonsense thinking capable of reflective reasoning about situations involving physical, social, and mental dimensions. EM-ONE uses as its knowledge base a library of commonsense narratives, each describing the physical, social, and mental activity that occurs during an interaction between several actors. EM-ONE reasons with these narratives by applying "mental critics," procedures that debug problems that exist in the outside world or within EM-ONE itself. Mental critics draw upon commonsense narratives to suggest courses of action, methods for deliberating about the circumstances and consequences of those actions, and—when things go wrong—ways to reflect upon and debug the activity of previously invoked mental critics. Mental critics are arranged into six layers, the reactive, deliberative, reflective, self-reflective, self-conscious, and self-ideals layers. The selection of mental critics within these six layers is itself guided by a separate collection of meta-level critics that recognize what overall problem-type presently confronts the system. EM-ONE was developed and tested within an artificial life domain where simulated robotic actors face concrete physical and social problems. A detailed scenario is presented where EM-ONE enables two such actors to work together to build a table by engaging reactive, deliberative, and reflective processes operating across the physical, social, and mental realms.},

abstract = {We introduce a new dissimilarity function for ranked lists, the expected weighted Hoeffding distance, that has several advantages over current dissimilarity measures for ranked search results. First, it is easily customized for users who pay varying degrees of attention to websites at different ranks. Second, unlike existing measures such as general- ized Kendall’s tau, it is based on a true metric, preserving meaningful embeddings when visualization techniques like multi-dimensional scaling are applied. Third, our measure can effectively handle partial or missing rank information while retaining a probabilistic interpretation. Finally, the measure can be made computationally tractable and we give a highly efficient algorithm for computing it. We then apply our new metric with multi-dimensional scaling to visualize and explore relationships between the result sets from dif- ferent search engines, showing how the weighted Hoeffding distance can distinguish important differences in search en- gine behavior that are not apparent with other rank-distance metrics. Such visualizations are highly effective at summa- rizing and analyzing insights on which search engines to use, what search strategies users can employ, and how search re- sults evolve over time. We demonstrate our techniques using a collection of popular search engines, a representative set of queries, and frequently used query manipulation methods.},

@article{Teevan2008,
abstract = {When a person issues a query, that person has expectations about the search results that will be returned. These expectations can be based on the current information need, but are also influenced by how the searcher believes the search engine works, where relevant results are expected to be ranked, and any previous searches the individual has run on the topic. This paper looks in depth at how the expectations people develop about search result lists during an initial query affect their perceptions of and interactions with future repeat search result lists. Three studies are presented that give insight into how people recall, recognize, and reuse results. The first study (a study of recall) explores what people recall about previously viewed search result lists. The second study (a study of recognition) builds on the first to reveal that people often recognize a result list as one they have seen before even when it is quite different. As long as those aspects that the searcher remembers about the initial list remain the same, other aspects can change significantly. This is advantageous because, as the third study (a study of reuse) shows, when a result list appears to have changed, people have trouble re-using the previously viewed content in the list. They are less likely to find what they are looking for, less happy with the result quality, more likely to find the task hard, and more likely to take a long time searching. Although apparent consistency is important for reuse, people’s inability to recognize change makes consistency without stagnation possible. New relevant results can be presented where old results have been forgotten, making both old and new content easy to find.},

PMI-IR is empirically evaluated using 80 synonym test questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and 50 synonym test ques- tions from a collection of tests for students of English as a Second Language (ESL). On both tests, the algorithm obtains a score of 74\%. PMI-IR is con- trasted with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), which achieves a score of 64\% on the same 80 TOEFL questions. The paper discusses potential applications of the new unsupervised learning algorithm and some implications of the results for LSA and LSI (Latent Semantic Indexing).},

abstract = {Creativity support tools gainedmuch interest in recent years. Companies claim creativity as their strength and interdisciplinary project teams work together for innovative outcomes. The growth of social networks together with the internet enhances a place independent collaboration. A common understanding of creativity is the development of something novel and useful. Supporting the development of creative ideas is a dificult task due to the fact that creativity can hardly be defined and varies on the field it occurs [5]. The analysis of creativity and knowledge is a challenging task. Knowledge Engineering [60] is a field with the aim to derive new knowledge from data and information. Data and Text Mining techniques are used to analyse huge amounts of data for interconnections and patterns. Knowledge about creativity has to be based on a model of computational creativity that bridges the gap between abstract theoretical models and techniques of implementation. Knowledge representation is essential for a consistent storage of gained knowledge and its reuse. Existing data and text mining techniques [59] [2] in the field of knowledge engineering leave a gap in the area of creativity and transliteracy. The main aim of the proposed research is the development of a creativity mining system based on Web 2.0 compliant models of computational creativity and knowl- edge representation. It adresses the features freshness, incompleteness, imprecision, inconsistency and trustfulness. The system is based on individual and commonly agreed system knowledge created by user interaction. A Self-Organizing Map [33] is used for storing and clustering information using similarity measures. This report will outline the motivation and objectives for the proposed creativity mining system. It will dis- cuss initial results and present a time scale for further development. Furthermore, it will review literature from the knowledge engineering and computational creativity domain.},

What makes the strawberry particularly interesting is that, whilst following this rigid structure in terms of its seed formation, it develops from a larger ‘rhizomatic’ arrangement: its supporting runners cross over and swerve in indeterminate directions. The growth and structure of the strawberry (formal patterns ensconced within a more unpredictable and arbitrary network) can be seen as emblematic of the ways in which art and language perform in postmodernity, and may be explored in terms of a ‘pataphysical reality of ‘as if’ rather than one of ‘as it is’.},

Although there are similarities between the activities of the Oulipo and the new approach to computer-assisted literary analysis, the development of tools for the express purpose of encouraging scholars to play with texts does not follow the model of Oulipian research into potentialities. For the Oulipo, potential text analysis is less a question of interpreting literature than of supplying algorithms for the good use one can make of reading. Producing exemplary interpretations with algorithms is a secondary consideration. Oulipian constraints are better understood as toys with no intended purpose rather than as tools we use with some objective in mind. The procedures for making sense of texts provide for their own interpretation: they are not only instruments for discovering meaning but also reflections on making meaning.},

abstract = {Web-based technology is often the technology of choice for distance education given the ease of use of the tools to browse the resources on the Web, the relative afford- ability of accessing the ubiquitous Web, and the simplic- ity of deploying and maintaining resources on the World- Wide Web. Many sophisticated web-based learning envi- ronments have been developed and are in use around the world. The same technology is being used for electronic commerce and has become extremely popular. However, while there are clever tools developed to understand on- line customer’s behaviours in order to increase sales and profit, there is very little done to automatically discover access patterns to understand learners’ behaviour on web- based distance learning. Educators, using on-line learning environments and tools, have very little support to evalu- ate learners’ activities and discriminate between different learners’ on-line behaviours. In this paper, we discuss some data mining and machine learning techniques that could be used to enhance web-based learning environments for the educator to better evaluate the leaning process, as well as for the learners to help them in their learning endeavour.},

The unification here is in the sense that the proposed framework is discipline-independent. Co-creation and the effect of collaboration on the creative processes are properly addressed as concurrency is treated as a fundamental dimension within our theory. Being formally sound, the proposed allow us to reason about temporal properties which governs the nature of creative processes. The approach is supported by a tool set, known as the De Montfort Creativity Assistant which consists of two major pluggable components: (1) De Montfort Collaborative environment, an integrated tool support which allows real-time collaboration between creators; and (2) the Creativity Mapper which maps the creativity process of a creator. Creativity maps from a number of disciplines (art and engineering) are produced as illustrative examples of the approach.},

Abstraction is often interpreted as the act of hiding irrelevant details. What constitute as relevant details is often left open to different interpretations.A unified approach for reverse engineering is described within which the notion of abstraction is classified and precisely defined. Abstraction rules are given and applied to various small examples.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is the future trend for enterprise software solutions, which means a lot of legacy systems will need to be either adapted to fit the requirement of cloud computing or to be purged and redesigned from scratch. However, enterprise software is far too complex for any human being to understand as a whole. This paper proposes a novel approach to reengineering enterprise software for cloud computing by building an ontology for enterprise software and then partitioning the enterprise software ontology to decompose enterprise software into potential service candidates. Ontology development process includes three steps, namely, building ontologies for source code, data, and application framework respectively, integrating captured ontologies and deploying the final produced ontology. Firstly, the ontology development process is supported by the reverse engineering and model transformation techniques. Secondly, the ontology integration is based on ontology engineering research. Thirdly, the deployment of enterprise software ontology is done through the software reengineering activities. Once the ontology is built, there will be a link between ontology and enterprise software. By analysing the concepts and relations in ontology, the enterprise software will be understood and decomposed as different service candidates.},
