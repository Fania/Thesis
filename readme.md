## ARTY BOLLOCKS


1 My work explores the relationship between multiculturalism and multimedia experiences.

2 With influences as diverse as Kierkegaard and Roy Lichtenstein, new insights are synthesised from both explicit and implicit dialogues.

3 Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the traditional understanding of the human condition. What starts out as triumph soon becomes debased into a hegemony of defeat, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the unlikelihood of a new synthesis.

4 As shimmering phenomena become frozen through studious and personal practice, the viewer is left with a clue to the limits of our culture.
