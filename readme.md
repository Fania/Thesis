## Errors

When LaTeX finds an error like this, it displays the error message and pauses. You must type one of the following letters to continue:

**x**	 Stop and exit
**q** Carry on quietly
**e** Stop the program and open editor at error
**h** Help
**i** Input correction in place of error and carry on
**r**	Run in non-stop mode

To quiet an error of chktex add ```% chktex XX''' to the end of the relevant line.


## ARTY BOLLOCKS


1 My work explores the relationship between multiculturalism and multimedia experiences.

2 With influences as diverse as Kierkegaard and Roy Lichtenstein, new insights are synthesised from both explicit and implicit dialogues.

3 Ever since I was a teenager I have been fascinated by the traditional understanding of the human condition. What starts out as triumph soon becomes debased into a hegemony of defeat, leaving only a sense of what could have been and the unlikelihood of a new synthesis.

4 As shimmering phenomena become frozen through studious and personal practice, the viewer is left with a clue to the limits of our culture.
