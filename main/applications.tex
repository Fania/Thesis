\section{Andrew Dennis}

\todo{write up stuff about Dennis' work and add reference}

Andrew Dennis recent undergraduate thesis entitled ``Investigation of a patadata-based ontology for text based search and replacement'' \citeyear{Dennis2016} used some of my work presented in this thesis (and previous publications). He contacted me about my project and we exchanged a few emails. I gave him the below feedback for his thesis.

\begin{quotation}
  My understanding of this project (purely based on reading this report - I have not seen or tested the actual product) is as follows:

  1. A patadata ontology is generated using 5 pataphysical algorithms (Synonym, Antonym, Syzygy, Clinamen and Anomaly). \\
  2. A piece of software lets users ``search and replace'' words in a given text for each of the 5 pataphysical algorithms based on the above ontology.

  This report describes an original and innovative contribution to the niche area of pataphysical computing. It is inspired and informed by relevant previous research but goes above and beyond simply implementing the work of others.

  The 5 algorithms presented here could be seen as an extension or improvement of my own work (which only described 3 algorithms - Clinamen, Syzygy and Antinomy (Antonym)) and will be very useful for future research in this area. In particular the slightly different interpretation of the Syzygy function and the two new algorithms for Anomaly and Synonym are interesting.

  The premise of the search and replace tool is simple but has great potential for creative use. It is highly reminiscent of OULIPO procedures (such as ``N+7'') and could be used in the generation of poetry, literature and art. 

  Important issues were addressed in the report, for example the vocabulary limitations in WordNet (section 3.2.3), the stemming problem (section 3.2.6) and the performance of patadata-generation (section 4.1.1). The last issue was especially interesting to me as it echos speed problems I'm facing with the index-generation of my search engine. Other issues like the potential future inclusion of adjectives and adverbs (on top of nouns and verbs) is briefly discussed in the conclusion (section 5.1).

  Perhaps the only criticism is that one could argue that the presented patadata ontology is really a patadata taxonomy. Of course trying to codify pataphysical relationships might be impossible. Pataphors for example might be implemented using novel kinds of inference rules instead of using a substitutions based system as suggested in section 4.2.2.

  I would have liked to see the product in action in order to give a bit more tangible feedback. I am hoping that perhaps in the future we can integrate the tool described in this report into my website \url{pata.physics.wtf} as it would complement my ``search engine'' perfectly. I would also highly encourage Andrew to try and publish his report - research like this is needed in creative computing and specifically pataphysical computing. \sourceatright{\autocite{Raczinski2016a}}
\end{quotation}

Dennis proposes five pataphysical algorithms. Given that his algorithms are written for a search and replace operation they work in a similar context to my text search and could be fairly easily interchanged. His algorithms are described below. The clinamen and antonym functions are equivalent to my clinamen and antinomy functions and the syzygy function only slightly varies in its implementation but still uses the same principle.
\todo{add links to my code for algorithms, see chapter XYZ}

\begin{description}
  \item[Synonym (equivalent)] a set of synonyms generated using WordNet
  \item[Antonym (opposite)] antonyms of synonyms generated using WordNet
  \item[Syzygy] generated from synonyms of hypernyms of synonyms using WordNet
  \item[Anomaly] generated using a random word from an input dictionary
  \item[Clinamen] generated using Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm
\end{description}

A screenshot of Dennis' tool is shown in figure~\ref{fig:dennis}. It gives a good idea of the functionality of the tool. It's a standalone application that allows users to upload or use an existing ontology. They can then enter a search term and a source text and the seacrh etrm is replaced by a pataphysicalised version in the complete version of the specified source. Users can choose which algorithm to use for the pataphysicalisation and further manually edit the text and save it as an \gls{html} file.

\section{Digital Opera}

A prototype of \url{pata.physics.wtf}---available at \url{pata.fania.eu} at the time---was used in the production of a `Digital Opera' called \emph{The Imaginary Voyage} --- \url{http://www.theimaginaryvoyage.com/} --- by Lee Scott, Andrew Hugill, Frederic Wake-Walker and The Opera Group\footnote{\url{http://www.mahoganyoperagroup.co.uk/}}.

The specific title of the relevant act of the opera is \emph{The Amorphous Isle}\footnote{See \url{http://theimaginaryvoyage.com/Islands/Amorphous/amorphous_isle_high.php}}. It is described below in the words of Alfred Jarry:

\begin{quotation}
  The Island is like soft coral, amoeboid and protoplasmic: its trees closely resemble the gesture of snails making horns at us.
\end{quotation}

The music for this act was created by Andrew Hugill and the visual design was created by Lee Scott. The libretto was generated by Lee Scott using my tool.

\label{fig:opera}
\end{figure}

Practically, the idea of this act of the opera is to navigate the map shown in figure XYZ to explpre the different musical themes and hear different parts of the libretto. In the centre is a circle which displays images based on the current mood.

\begin{quotation}
  There is an official and an unofficial way that I used the prototype. Officially, I threw keywords based on mood ``sad'', ``lively'' etc into it and used the results as the libretto for small sections of music that reflect said mood. Unofficially I used lots and lots of different words to retrieve the lines that worked. \sourceatright{Lee Scott (22 May 2014) personal communication}

The source text for the libretto is shown below. Mood keywords are shown in bold with possible lines for the libretto below.

The purpose of using \url{pata.fania.eu} was to pataphysicalise the lyrics or the opera. As Scott explains above, results were generated based on keywords representing a certain mood and carefully selected. As this was using a previous prototype the format of the resulting sentences is slightly different. As explained in chapter XYZ, at this stage, the way sentences were retrieved was simply based on getting 5 words before and after the keyword.

\section{Patakosmos}

\url{pata.fania.eu} was featured on \url{www.patakosmos.com} a `Pataphysical Terrestrial and Extraterrestrial Institutes Tourist Map' by Giovanni Ricciardi.

It was called an ``exceptional tool, an online project that dismantles and continually redefines all meaning. La ‘pataphysique est la fin des fins.''\footnote{See \url{http://www.patakosmos.com/tool_pataphysical_search/}}
