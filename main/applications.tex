Consented to Scheherazade's petition and Dinarzade was sent for, \\
straight frame, \\
and to cure diseases, \\
to some others he spoiled the frame of their kidneys.

Qui peut l'espérer ?... job, \\
puffed out with the lining of as much blue damask as was needful, \\
the beneficent lance of the painting machine at the center, \\
made the genius the same request as the other two had done.

Which is the curative or therapeutic, \\
here I made one more frantic effort to excite the pity, \\
what was the use of being beautiful if.

Ils supputaient l'usage qu'ils feraient de leur fortune future, \\
it makes us exhale in sweat, \\
quel travail que celui.

  There is an official and an unofficial way that I used the prototype. Officially, I threw keywords based on mood ``sad'', ``lively'' etc into it and used the results as the libretto for small sections of music that reflect said mood. Unofficially I used lots and lots of different words to retrieve the lines that worked. \sourceatright{Lee Scott (22 May 2014)}
