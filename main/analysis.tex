CRITICAL ANALYSIS!


\section{Problems}

\todo{discuss problems with algorithms, pros and cons...}
This function exhibits the same problem as mentioned above for the syzygy, just much worse. Arguably, some words just do not appear to have an opposite, but the pataphysical antinomy should still be able to find a match. A better thesaurus or a larger index (e.g.\ based on more than one book –-- or, of course, the Web) could improve this method.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Antinomy algorithm not producing many results
  \item Image and Video search relying on APIs
  \item Performance slow
  \item
\end{itemize}


\section{Shortcomings}

From here, we can try to implement different algorithms or different pataphysical concepts within our existing tool or built a different system. The next logical step would be to implement a fully functioning Web search engine using the algorithms described in this paper. But before we go into further development, it might be worth evaluating and interpreting the results produced by the prototype.

\section{Focus Group}

\todo{TODO:FOCUS2, study on evaluation before and after framework}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item ask people to judge prototype
  \item explain criteria and framework
  \item ask to judge prototype again
  \item compare results
\end{enumerate}
