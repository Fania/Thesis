The website \url{http://pata.physics.wtf} showcases the current proof-of-concept algorithms. This chapter gives an overview of the structure of the website and the development process.

Typically, software development is divided into so-called front and back ends. The frontend includes web design and web development and is meant to provide an interface for the end-user to communicate with the backend which involves a server, an application and a database (although this is not completely true in this project).

The frontend design is created using the \textbf{w3.css} stylesheet as a basis. The website is mostly responsive, meaning it can be viewed well on phones, tablets and screens (the poems and image spirals for example unfortunately have a fixed width which does not scale down well). The site contains various scripts written in \textbf{Javascript} (e.g. scramble letters, randomise poem, send email and tabbed content).\footnote{frontend links: \url{http://www.w3schools.com/w3css/}, \url{https://www.javascript.com/}}

The backend relies heavily on a \textbf{Python} framework called \textbf{Flask}. Most of the code is written in Python although some parts require a specific templating language called \textbf{Jinja} which renders content into HTML. The application uses several \acrshort{api}'s (Microsoft Translator, Bing, YouTube, Flickr, Getty and WordNet) and is version controlled using \textbf{Git}.\footnote{backend links: \url{https://www.python.org/}, \url{http://flask.pocoo.org/}, \url{http://jinja.pocoo.org/}, \url{https://git-scm.com/}}

The folder structure is as follows:

- app\\
--- static\\
----- css\\
----- images\\
----- corpus\\
--- templates\\
- .git\\
- dev.py\\
- guni.py\\
- live.py\\
- .gitignore\\

\todo{folder structure}

\begin{comment}
  To provide a short overview, the tools’s workflow can be described as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Tokenise texts and remove stopwords to build index,
    \item a query triggers the three pataphysical algorithms,
    \item each algorithm finds results for the query,
    \item retrieve some words before/after match for context, and
    \item render the resulting sentences.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{comment}

\todo{add audio? update this section depending on what i do}

From the homepage users can choose between text, image and video search. Then they can enter a query --- in the case of text search this should be single words only, image and video search support multi word queries.


\section{Corpus}

Instead of crawling the Internet the present tool uses a local collection of texts in its text-search. The corpus used resembles the fictional library of ``equivalent books'' from Alfred Jarry's \emph{Exploits and Opinions of Dr.\ Faustroll, $'$Pataphysician} \citeyear[p.10-12]{Jarry1996}\footnote{``In addition, three prints hanging on the walls, a poster by TOULOUSE-LAUTREC, \emph{Jane Avril}; one by BONNARD, advertising the \emph{Revue Blanche}; a portrait of Doctor Faustroll, by AUBREY BEARDSLEY\@; and an old picture, which appeared to us to be valueless, \emph{Saint Cado}, issued by the Oberthuer printing house of Rennes.''\parencite[p.12]{Jarry1996}}. In principle the \hypertarget{corpus}{corpus}\label{ref:corpus} is just a folder within the tool's directory structure which contains the following files:

\begin{enumerate}[start=0]
\item Alfred Jarry: \emph{Exploits and Opinions of Dr.\ Faustroll, $'$Pataphysician}

\section{Setup}

When the server is first started various setup functions are executed before any HTML is rendered. The search algorithms are triggered once a user enters a search term into the query field of any of the text, image or video pages.

Each plain text file in the corpus is processed. Source~\ref{code:addtocorpus} shows how this is done. The `PlaintextCorpusReader' is a feature of the \textbf{NTLK} Python library for \acrlong{nlp}.

\begin{listing}
  \begin{minted}{python}
    library = PlaintextCorpusReader(corpus_root, '.*\.txt')
    l_00 = library.words('00.faustroll.txt')
    l_01 = library.words('01.poe1.txt')
    ...
    l_27 = library.words('27.verne.txt')
  \end{minted}
\caption{Adding text files to the corpus library.}
\label{code:addtocorpus}
\end{listing}


This means each word is added to a dictionary data structure together with the file ID's they occur in and a list of each position. Stopwords and non-alphabetic words are ignored (for a list of english stopwords see appendix~\ref{app:code}). After all files are read in the index looks like this:

\begin{minted}{c}
  {
    word1: {fileA: [pos1, pos2, ...], fileB: [pos], ...},
    word2: {fileC: [pos1, pos2], fileK: [pos], ...},
    ...
  }
\end{minted}

Using one of the terms from figure~\ref{termdocs} on page~\pageref{termdocs}, here are their entries in the index file (the files are represented by their number in the \hyperlink{corpus}{corpus} (see page~\pageref{ref:corpus}), i.e. \textbf{l\_00} is the `Faustroll' file, \textbf{l\_01} is the `Poe' file, etc.). An excerpt from the actual file can be found in the appendix~\ref{app:code}.

      l_27: [16270, 79245]
    }, ...
  }
\end{minted}

The `setupcorpus' function (see source~\ref{code:setupcorpus}) is called for each of the text files in the corpus to populate the index data structure.

\begin{listing}
  \begin{minted}{python}
    # $f$ = input text file
    # $lang$ = language of the text
    def setupcorpus(file, lang):
        # $x$ = counter/position
        for x, word in enumerate(file):
            if word.isalpha() and (word.lower() not in lang):
                # Creates names like `l_00' based on `00.faustroll.txt', etc.
                y = 'l_' + (re.search(r"((\d\d).(\w)+.txt)", file.fileid)).group(2)
                # Creates/appends an entry for the current word $w$ in the index $l_dict$ and creates/appends an entry for the current file with its new name $y$.
                # As we go through the file word by word, the counter $x$ represents the words position in the file.
                # $x$ is added to the list of positions of $w$ in $y$.
                l_dict[word.lower()][y].append(x)
  \end{minted}
\caption{`setupcorpus' function to process the corpus and create the index.}

\section{Algorithms}

After the setup stage is completed and the webpage is fully loaded, user input in the form of a text query is required to trigger the three pataphysical algorithms.

Image and Video search do not use all three algorithms --- where relevant this is highlighted in each section. Generally the following descriptions refer to the text search functionality.


\subsection{Clinamen}

The clinamen is the unpredictable swerve that Bök calls ``the smallest possible aberration that can make the greatest possible difference'' \parencite{Boek2002}.

The clinamen algorithm works in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item get clinamen words based on dameraulevenshtein and faustroll
  \item get sentences from corpus that match clinamen words
\end{enumerate}

\todo{find ref for dameraulevenshtein in baeza-yates book?}

It uses the `faustroll' text by Alfred Jarry as a base document and the Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm \parencite{Damerau1964, Levenshtein1966}, which measures the distance between two strings (with 0 indicating equality), to find words that are similar but not quite the same. The distance is calculated using insertion, deletion, substitution of a single character, or transposition of two adjacent characters. This means that we are basically forcing the program to return matches that are of distance two or one, meaning they have two or one spelling errors in them.

\begin{minted}{python}
  Clinamen (t):
    matches = {v: 0 < dameraulevenshtein (t, v) <= 2},   for v $\in$ V
    sentences =
    return matches
\end{minted}

The key idea here is .... \todo{finish}

\begin{equation}
  clinamen(t) = [v \colon 0 < dameraulevenshtein(t,v) \leq 2] \ \text{for} \ v \in V
\label{eq:clinamen}
\end{equation}
\myequations{clinamen}

Where:\\
\itab{$t$} \tab{is the query term,}\\
\itab{$V$} \tab{is the vocabulary of `faustroll'.}\\




\subsection{Syzygy}

The syzygy surprises and confuses. It originally comes from astronomy and denotes the alignment of three celestial bodies in a straight line. In a pataphysical context it is the pun. It usually describes a conjunction of things, something unexpected and surprising. Unlike serendipity, a simple chance encounter, the syzygy has a more scientific purpose.

For the syzygy function, we made use of WordNet [29] through the NLTK python library [26] to find suitable results. Specifically, as shown in Eq. (2), the algorithm fetches the set of synonyms (synsets) first and then finds any hyponyms, hypernyms or holonyms for each of those (each of which denotes some sort of relationship or membership with its parent synonym). This mimics the syzygy alignment of three words in a line mentioned earlier (query $\to$ synonym $\to$ hypo/hyper/holonym).

This algorithm makes heavy use of WordNet. Line 1 creates a set of all synonyms for query term t from WordNet. It then loops through all individual items in the list of synonyms in line 2 to 5. Line 3 adds all hyponyms h for the current synonym s if there exists a word in the vocabulary same as the hyponym. Similarly lines 4 and 5 add all hypernyms and holonyms to the results list which is then returned in line 6.

\begin{minted}{python}
  Syzygy (t):
    synonyms = { s $\in$ WordNet-synsets (t) }
    for each s in synonyms:
      hypo   = { h: h $\in$ WordNet-hyponyms (s) }
      hyper = { h: h $\in$ WordNet-hypernyms (s) }
      holo    = { h: h $\in$ WordNet-holonyms (s) }
      union = hypo $\cup$ hyper $\cup$ holo
      add { h: h $\in$ union and $\exists$ h $\in$ V } to results
    return results
\end{minted}

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  syzygy(t) &= \{ h \colon h \in union(t) \ \text{and} \ \exists \ h \in V \}\\% chktex 21
  union(t) &= hypo(t) \cup hyper(t) \cup holo(t)\\
  hypo(t) &= \{ h \colon h \in hyponyms(s) \}, \text{for} \ s \in syno(t)\\
  hyper(t) &= \{ h \colon h \in hypernyms(s) \}, \text{for} \ s \in syno(t)\\
  holo(t) &= \{ h \colon h \in holonyms(s) \}, \text{for} \ s \in syno(t)\\
  syno(t) &= \{ s \colon s \in synonyms(t) \}
\end{split}
\label{eq:syzygy}
\end{equation}
\myequations{syzygy}

\subsection{Antinomy}

The antimony, in a pataphysical sense, is the mutually incompatible.

For the antinomy we simply used WordNet’s antonyms (opposites) (see Eq. (3)). This function exhibits the same problem as mentioned above for the syzygy, just much worse.  Arguably, some words just do not appear to have an opposite, but the pataphysical antinomy should still be able to find a match. A better thesaurus or a larger index (e.g.\ based on more than one book – or, of course, the Web) could improve this method.

This algorithm is very similar to the algorithm for the syzygy. It finds all antonyms through WordNet and returns them if they appear in our dictionary of words.

\begin{minted}{python}
  Antinomy (t):
    synonyms = { s $\in$ WordNet-synsets (t) }
    for each s in synonyms:
      add { h $\in$ WordNet-antonyms (s): $\exists$ h $\in$ V } to results
    return results
\end{minted}

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  antinomy( t ) &= \{ h \colon h \in anto( t ) \ \text{and} \ \exists \ h \in V \}\\% chktex 21
  anto( t ) &= \{ h \colon h \in antonyms( s ) \}, \text{for} \ s \in syno( t )\\
  syno( t ) &= \{ s \colon s \in synonyms( t ) \}
  \end{split}
\label{eq:antinomy}
\end{equation}
\myequations{antinomy}







\section{Implementation}

Linking back to some of the creative, pataphysical concepts we have discussed earlier, let us put some of the ideas for our tool into perspective. The constraints for our conceptual space are the pataphysical rules that we want to apply to our data. We use those rules to explore, combine and transform our space; giving us the flexibility and freedom we need to find interesting results.

We developed the idea of pataphysicalising data as the process of applying such pataphysical rules in order to produce creative search results. This pataphysicalisation process forms a central component of our system (see Figure~\ref{fig:patasearch01}) and influences all areas of the search tool.

\end{figure}


\section{User experience}

Whilst developing a system that returns creative results to the end user has numerous advantages, the assumptions that are made about and the decisions we take for the user must still be considered. For example, presume that the user inputs a search request `The Cat in the Hat' after reading a Dr.\ Seuss book to their child, and the system employs an anomalous method on the query and searched `sunglasses'. Whilst there is logic to the new search request, it is anomalous to the initial request, if the user receives these results without being told what method was used, the results will appear random, and therefore are likely to be detrimental to the user. Therefore the level of interaction the user has with the system and the feedback the system gives to the user on decisions it is making will have a large influence on the overall effectiveness and appreciation of the search tool. A quick and simple solution to this problem would be to add an icon to the side of each search result which displays how the original query was pataphysicalised.

\begin{figure}[htb] % (here, top, bottom, page)
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/resultexample}
\caption[Feedback button]{Feedback button}
\label{fig:feedback}
\end{figure}

The above image (figure~\ref{fig:feedback}) shows an example of how this could be implemented. The little green candle (a reference to pataphysics in itself by the way) shows a pop-up note when hovered over with the mouse pointer. In this case the original query could have been `tree' and `car' was returned as an opposite to that.
