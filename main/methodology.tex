This project combines research in science, art and the humanities---making it transdisciplinary.

\begin{description}
  \item [Pataphysics]: Literature, Philosophy, Art
  \item [Creativity]: Cognitive Science, \gls{ai}, \gls{dh}
  \item [Computing]: \gls{ir}, \gls{nlp}, Web Development
\end{description}

\todo{insert diagram here, see onenote}

Traditional methodologies in these disciplines are very subject specific and a project combining elements of each field is left mixing and matching suitable methods from them all.

In this chapter I will outline the reasons why none of the existing methodologies are suitable for this project and then explain the choice of more transdisciplinary methods and how I combined them to suit my needs.

\todo{go over intro again when rest is written}

As mentioned in the~\nameref{ch:introduction}\marginnote{ยง~\ref{s:intromethod}} the overall objectives of this project are to:

\label{s:objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item create pataphysical search algorithms,
  \item create creative exploratory search tool demonstrating the algorithms,
  \item create set of subjective parameters for defining creativity,
  \item create objective framework for evaluating creativity.
\end{enumerate}

Research methods that support these tasks are needed and I will address these four points again at the end of this chapter\marginnote{ยง~\ref{s:mymeth}}.


\section{Intradisciplinary}

Different disciplines prefer different research methodologies. It makes sense that research in medicine, chemistry, literature or mathematics all use different methods. What could a mathematician achieve in a white laboratory coat and test tubes in his hand, and similarly, what could a chemist achieve with pen, paper and a calculator?

Of the various disciplines that inform this research the specific subareas that are relevant are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Information Retrieval
  \item Interface Design
  \item Poetry and Literature
  \item Philosophy
  \item Human and Machine Creativity
  \item Creative Computing
  \item Computational Creativity
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Technology}

Half of this projects objectives are related to computer science therefore it is important to consider how research in this discipline is traditionally approached.

A framework for finding a suitable approach was suggested by Holz et al \citeyear{Holz2006}. The following four steps form an iterative process. ``What do we want to achieve?'' e.g. find out what is happening, develop something that works, evaluate an existing system/technology, compare existing systems, change human behaviour. ``Where does the data come from?'' e.g. how to collect? (read, observe, ask, measure, experiment, model) and where to collect? (field, laboratory, conceptual). ``What do we do with the data?'', e.g. identify themes/patterns/quotes, calculate numbers, identify trends, express via multimedia, create frameworks/taxonomies. ``Have we achieved our goal?'' e.g. draw conclusions, evaluate results, identify limitations.

\todo{explain a bit more about these}

Another option is to look at what computer science researchers have done historically. In a rather old but still insightful analysis of over 600 papers\footnote{While the paper itself was published in 2004, the body of work they studied was based on publicationsfrom between 1995 and 1999---this suggests that a lot of the more ``recent'' research around Web technologies is not included in this study.} Ramesh et al \citeyear{Ramesh2004} have shown that---by far---the most common approach to research in computer science during this period was \emph{formulative} with almost 79\% use (as opposed to ``descriptive'' with 10\% and ``evaluative'' with 11\%) in particular in regards to ``processes, methods and algorithms'' which was used by just over 50\% of researchers. Not surprisingly the most popular research method was \emph{mathematical conceptual analysis} with about 75\% use.

Jose Nelson Amaral \citeyear{Amaral} classifies methodologies in computer science into five main categories as shown below.

\textbf{Formal}: Proof, verification, correctness\\
\textbf{Experimental}: Testing, evaluation, question answering\\
\textbf{Build}: Proof of concept, prototype, artefact\\
\textbf{Process}: Understand and define processes\\
\textbf{Model}: Abstraction, simulations

\spirals

Based on \autocite{Holz2006}, here are this projects answers to the four questions posed in the research.

\begin{description}
  \item[What do we want to achieve?]~
    - Understand human creativity and how this translates to machines.\\
    - Understand the relationship of pataphysics and creativity.\\
    - Understand how creativity is evaluated in humans and machines.\\
    - Formulate suitable pataphysical concepts to be implemented as algorithms.\\ 
    - Define algorithms.\\
    - Implement prototype incorporating algorithms.\\
    - Develop framework for interpreting and evaluating machine creativity.
	\item[Where does the data come from?]~
    - Read pataphysical literature and research.\\
    - Collate existing research on creativity and evaluation.\\
    - Survey creative approaches to technology.\\
    - Experimentation with algorithms and implementation.\\
	\item[What do we do with the data?]~
    - Iterate through developmental stages of algorithmic outputs.\\
    - Demonstrate algorithms in action.\\
    - Create an artefact (prototype) that represents the underlying philosophy and research as a whole.\\
    - Create evaluation framework based on theoretical research.
  \item[Have we achieved our goal?]~
    - Subjectively evaluate artefact.\\
    - Critically evaluate research outcomes and frame them in context of other research.
\end{description}

Referring back to the objectives above\marginnote{ยง~\ref{s:objectives}}, objective 1 is to create new creative search algorithms. This is not supposed to happen on a purely abstract basis but in a practical fashion (\emph{experimental}), with a working implementation (\emph{build}) as proof of concept (see objective 2). While the algorithms need to be defined in formal terms (\emph{formal}), the goal here is not to create a theoretical proof of correctness (given the creative and rather subjective nature of the underlying philosophy this is virtually impossible) but a practical demonstration of the creative processes behind. Given the creative nature of the algorithms, rigorous testing would be irrelevant. Overall this would suggest an experimental approach with prototyping of an artefact. Objective 3 is to come up with a suitable definition of creativity (\emph{process}). This should be informed by existing research. Again, we are not interested in formulating this in mathematical terms and proofs but rather a more esoteric and systemic view. Because the definition needs to apply to humans and machines it needs to be precise enough. Objective 4 is then to create an overall theoretical framework (\emph{model}) for the evaluation of creativity in humans and machines.

By now we have managed to cover every one of the major methodologies mentioned in \autocite{Amaral} but we are still lacking ways to address the subjective and creative nature of the project. Furthermore, the philosophical and artistic inspirations that inform the development of the artefact don't get enough of a voice in these methods. In computer science, implementations are generally seen as a proof of concepts or prototypes when really they should be seen as artefacts in the sense of artistic pieces of work. So, to really appreciate the scope of the practical element of this project we need to consider research in the Arts and Humanities too.


\subsection{Arts and Humanities}



\begin{quotation}
  A hallmark of humanistic study is that research is approached differently than in the natural and social sciences, where data and hard evidence are required to draw conclusions. Because the human experience cannot be adequately captured by facts and figures alone, humanities research employs methods that are historical, interpretive and analytical in nature.\footnote{\url{http://shc.stanford.edu/how-humanities-research-conducted}}

  Anne Burdick et al have written an authoritative manifesto for the field of \gls{dh} \citeyear{Burdick2012}. Computing has had a big impact on the humanities as a discipline so much so that \gls{dh} was born of the encounter between the two \autocite[p.3]{Burdick2012}. In essence, it is characterised by \textbf{collaboration, transdisciplinarity and an engagement with computing} \autocite[p.122]{Burdick2012} but it should not simply be reduced to doing the humanities digitally \autocite[p.101]{Burdick2012}. It spans across many traditional areas of research, such as literature, philosophy, history, art, music, design and of course computer science.

  \begin{draft}
    Transliteracy\footnote{Sue Thomas et al.\ define transliteracy as `the ability to read, write and interact across a range of platforms, tools and media from signing and orality through handwriting, print, TV, radio and film, to digital social networks.' \autocite{Thomas2007}} therefore is fundamental \autocite{Thomas2007};
  \end{draft}

  `The field of Digital Humanities may see the emergence of polymaths who can ``do it all''\,': who can research, write, shoot, edit, code, model, design, network, and dialogue with users. \autocite[p.15]{Burdick2012} \gls{dh} encompasses several core activities which on various levels depend on and support each other.

  \subsubsection*{DESIGN}
  The authors suggest that `for digital humanists, design is a creative practice harnessing cultural, social, economic, and technological constraints in order to bring systems and objects into the world.' \autocite[p.13]{Burdick2012}

  In generative mode, these designers shape structural logics, rhetorical schemata, information hierarchies, experiential qualities, cultural positioning, and narrative strategies. When working analytically, their task is to visually interpret, remap or reframe, reveal patterns, deconstruct, reconstruct, situate, and critique. \autocite[p.12]{Burdick2012}

  \begin{quote}
    The parsing of the cultural record in terms of questions of authenticity, origin, transmission, or production is one of the foundation stones of humanistic scholar- ship upon which all other interpretive work depends. But editing is also productive and generative, and it is the suite of rhetorical devices that make a work. Editing is the creative, imaginative activity of making, and as such, design can be also seen as a kind of editing \autocite[p.18]{Burdick2012}

\section{Transdisciplinary}

Basarab Nicolescu distinguished between three different kinds of research `without stable boundaries between the disciplines'.\footnote{Nicolescu cites Jean Piaget here, who first coined the term `transdisciplinarity' in 1972.} \autocite{Nicolescu2010}.

\begin{description}
  \item [Multidisciplinarity]	concerns itself with studying a research topic in not just one discipline but in several simultaneously.
  \item [Interdisciplinarity]	concerns the transfer of methods from one discipline to another.
  \item [Transdisciplinarity]	concerns that which is at once between the disciplines, across the different disciplines, and beyond all disciplines.
\end{description}

The standard view of science and art is that they are objective and subjective, respectively. So, what does that mean for research conducted between, across and beyond science and art, i.e. research that is transdisciplinary?

Nicolescu criticises the view that science must be objective. He even claims that any non-scientific knowledge is `cast into the inferno of subjectivity, tolerated at most as a meaningless embellishment or rejected with contempt as a fantasy, an illusion, a regression, or a product of the imagination' \autocite{Nicolescu2010}. Objectivity\marginnote{ยง~\ref{ch:pataphysics}}, he says, becomes the `supreme criterion of Truth'\footnote{As we shall see later, pataphysics does the opposite: it reveres the Subject.}

\begin{quotation}
  The death of the Subject is the price we pay for objective knowledge. \sourceatright{\autocite{Nicolescu2010}}
\end{quotation}

He goes on to quote Werner Heisenberg on the concepts of objective and subjective reality: `we would make a very crude simplification if we want to divide the world in[to] one objective reality and one subjective reality. Many rigidities of the philosophy of the last centuries are born by this black and white view of the world.' \autocite[Heisenberg, cited in][]{Nicolescu2010}

\begin{quotation}
  The too strong insistence on the difference between scientific knowledge and artistic knowledge comes from the wrong idea that concepts describe perfectly the ``real things''. [โฆ] All true philosophy is situated on the threshold between science and poetry. \sourceatright{\autocite[Heisenberg, cited in][p.22]{Nicolescu2010} \footnote{The full paragraph is worth quoting: `The overly forceful insistence on the difference between scientific and artistic cognition quite likely derives from the incorrect notion that concepts are firmly attached to ``real objects'', as if words had a completely clear and definite meaning in their relationship to reality and as if an accurate sentence, constructed from those words, could deliver an intended ``objective'' factual situation to a more or less absolute degree. But we know, after all, that language too only grasps and shapes reality by turning it into ideas, by idealizing it. Language, too, approaches reality with specific mental forms about which we do not know right away which part of reality they can comprehend and shape. The question about ``right'' or ``wrong'' may indeed be rigorously posed and settled within an idealization, but not in relation to reality. That is why the last measure available for scientific knowledge as well is only the degree to which that knowledge is able to illuminate reality or, better, how that illumination allows us `to find our way' better. And who could question that the spiritual content of a work of art too illumines reality for us and makes it translucent? One must come to terms with the fact that only through the process of cognition itself can we determine what we are to understand by ``cognition''. That is why any genuine philosophy, too, stands on the threshold between science and poetry.' \autocite[Section 2, Chapter 6b]{Heisenberg1942}}}
\end{quotation}

In transdisciplinarity traditional disciplinary boundaries have no meaning. Objectivity is a myth.

Working across disciplines requires a new unique methodology. Nicolescu proposes a methodology of transdisciplinarity as a non-hierarchical ternary partition of `Subject, Object and Hidden Third'\marginnote{\faicon{object-group}~\ref{fig:trans}} rather than the traditional binary partition of `Subject versus Object'. \autocite{Nicolescu2010}.

%   \item \textbf{The ontological axiom}: There are, in Nature and society and in our knowledge of Nature and society, different levels of Reality of the Object and, correspondingly, different levels of Reality of the Subject.
%   \item \textbf{The logical axiom}: The passage from one level of Reality to another is ensured by the logic of the included middle.
%   \item \textbf{The complexity axiom}: The structure of the totality of levels of Reality or perception is a complex structure: every level is what it is because all the levels exist at the same time.

\begin{draft}
  Hugill and Yang suggest that existing research methodologies are unsuitable for transdisciplinary subjects such as \gls{cc}. The following is an example of a possible \gls{cc} research methodology they propose as a starting point \autocite[p.17]{Hugill2013c}:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Review literature across disciplines
    \item Identify key creative activities
    \item Analyse the processes of creation
    \item Propose approaches to support these activities and processes
    \item Design and implement software following this approach
    \item Experiment with the resulting system and propose framework
  \end{enumerate}

  They go on to propose four standards for \gls{cc} \autocite[p.17]{Hugill2013c} namely, resist standardisation, perpetual novelty, continuous user interaction and combinational, exploratory and or transformational.

\subsection{Practice Based}

Linda Candy defines practice based research as follows.

\begin{quotation}
  Practice-based Research is an original investigation undertaken in order to gain new knowledge partly by means of practice and the outcomes of that practice. \sourceatright{\autocite{Candy2006}}
\end{quotation}

She further explains that original contributions to knowledge required in PhD projects can be demonstrated through creative outcomes `in the form of designs, music, digital media, performances and exhibitions' \autocite{Candy2006}.

% \begin{fcom}
%   my practice is software development but framed in arty bollocks.
% \end{fcom}

\todo{finish section on practice based research here}

% \begin{quote}
%   ``Art research is of necessity speculative research. It produces its own protocols; the artist as researcher engages with knowledge in ways that involve the adoption of new frames of reference, the design of new systems and the acquisition of new behaviours. Outcomes will be generally non-linear, associative, connective, transformative and frequently challenging. Trans-disciplinary research in art generates discourse requiring new language.''\autocite[Roy Ascott's preface in][p. v]{Candy2011}
% \end{quote}

% \begin{quote}
%   ``In ways often disconcerting to its academic hosts, art research is prepared to look in all directions for inspiration, understanding and explication: to the East as well as the West, so to speak; following the left-hand path as well as the right; working with both reason and intuition, sense and nonsense, subtelty and sensibility. It is what can be called a transdisciplinary syncretism that best informs artistic research, just as it is the integrative faculty of โcyberceptionโ that enables our focus on mutliple realities and a technoetic instrumentality that supports art strategies involving the evolution of mind, the networked distribution of presence and the re-configuration of personal identity. Art research is second-order research; the researcher is always a part of the system or subject of inquiery. Innovation in subjectivity prevails over odurate objectivity. [...] methodologies that can, whenever needed, put subject before object, process before system, behaviour before form, intuition before reason and mind before matter.''\autocite[Roy Ascott's preface in][p. vi]{Candy2011}

\section{My Research Approach}
\label{s:mymeth}

\todo{rapid incremental prototyping}

The doctoral research presented in this thesis does not fit into neat categories in science or art---making it transdisciplinary in nature. Subjects like literature, philosophy, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, software engineering and linguistics frame the three core areas of research for this project, namely pataphysics, creativity and computing.

To address the transdisciplinary nature of the project I 


employed a practice-based research methodology, meaning that part of my submission for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy is an artefact demonstrating my original contribution to knowledge. The thesis provides the context of this artefact and critically analyses and discusses the experimental process and outcome.

\begin{description}
  \item [Epistemology] Transdisciplinary, Subjective
  \item [Methodology] Qualitative, Exploratory
  \item [Methods] Creative Computing, Website Development, Literature Review, Evaluation Framework, Critical Reflection
\end{description}

The general workflow of my project was as follows.
\begin{draft}
relates back to hugill and yang approach
\end{draft}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Conduct extensive literature review into the various subjects involved,
  \item develop pataphysical algorithms,
  \item develop an evaluation framework,
  \item design a system to demonstrate algorithms,
  \item develop a website for the tool,
  \item evaluate website using framework and redevelop as needed and
  \item write up findings.
\end{enumerate}

In regards to the practice based methodology, I followed the following trajectory inspired by the \gls{tmpr}\marginnote{\faicon{object-group}~\ref{fig:tmpr}}.

\todo{create my own tmpr figure here}

\begin{description}
  \item [Practice] (Works): Implementation of Algorithms, Development of Website
  \item [Theory] (Criteria, Frameworks): Creation of Algorithms, Setting Context, Define Evaluation Framework
  \item [Evaluation] (Results): Interpretation of Work
\end{description}

The general process\marginnote{ยง~\ref{ch:implementation}} of my project was as follows.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Conduct extensive literature review into the various subjects involved,
  \item develop pataphysical algorithms,
  \item develop an evaluation framework,
  \item design a system to demonstrate algorithms,
  \item develop a website for the tool,
  \item evaluate website using framework and redevelop as needed and
  \item write up findings.
\end{enumerate}


\todo{comp creat vs creat comp}
\begin{draft}
  list out the different examples of why my project is both of the above. 
  eg it is comp creat because i use javascript+maths for display the poetry
  but creat comp is the mis-use of damerau levensthein algorithm
\end{draft}
