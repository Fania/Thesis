\begin{alltt}\sffamily
Mid the silence that pants for breath,
when I thought myself at my last gasp,
haine ou de l'ambition et qui se,
the pale motor vessel withdrew its blue breath toward the island's horizon.

As pure and simple as a powder puff,
such also was the ambition of others upon the like occasion,
there was hardly a breath of air stirring,
mon ancien c≈ìur en une aspiration vers la vertu.

After drawing a long breath,
the silver ring she pull'd,
the suitor cried, or force shall drag thee hence.

For wild ambition wings their bold desire,
and with thine agony sobbed out my breath,
I will pull down my barns.
