\vfill

Mid the silence that pants for breath, \\
when I thought myself at my last gasp, \\
haine ou de l'ambition et qui se, \\
the pale motor vessel withdrew its blue breath toward the island's horizon.

As pure and simple as a powder puff, \\
such also was the ambition of others upon the like occasion, \\
there was hardly a breath of air stirring, \\
mon ancien cœur en une aspiration vers la vertu.

After drawing a long breath, \\
the silver ring she pull'd, \\
the suitor cried, or force shall drag thee hence.

For wild ambition wings their bold desire, \\
and with thine agony sobbed out my breath, \\
I will pull down my barns.

\section{PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS}

\todo{discuss problems with algorithms, pros and cons...}
This function exhibits the same problem as mentioned above for the syzygy, just much worse. Arguably, some words just do not appear to have an opposite, but the pataphysical antinomy should still be able to find a match. A better thesaurus or a larger index (e.g.\ based on more than one book –-- or, of course, the Web) could improve this method.

\section{SHORTCOMINGS AND MISSING FUNCTIONALITY}

From here, we can try to implement different algorithms or different pataphysical concepts within our existing tool or built a different system. The next logical step would be to implement a fully functioning Web search engine using the algorithms described in this paper. But before we go into further development, it might be worth evaluating and interpreting the results produced by the prototype.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Research in science and art
  \item Review paper? Pataphysics and creativity?
  \item Quantitative research questions
  \item Working definition for Pataphysics
  \item Examples for Pataphysics concepts
  \item Examples for types of creativity
  \item Examples for creative process
  \item Explain Leary's tables
  \item How can we use creative concepts discussed?
\end{itemize}
