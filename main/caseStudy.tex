\subsection{Use}

\begin{quote}
  "There is an official and an unofficial way that I used the prototype. Officially, I threw keywords based on mood 'sad', 'lively' etc into it and used the results as the libretto for small sections of music that reflect said mood. Unofficially I used lots and lots of different words to retrieve the lines that worked." Lee Scott (22 May 2014)
