This thesis describes a general study into computer creativity and in particular a pataphysical methodology applied to creative information retrieval.

A pataphysical methodology for applying creativity to exploratory search.

\todo{finish introduction}

In the following chapters, I will examine how pataphysics and creativity map onto one another, give an outline of the field of information retrieval...

\section{Problem / Motivation / Context}

Assumptions: computers can be creative.
\todo{complete assumptions}

From relevant to creative.

Why pataphysics?
Pataphysics is highly subjective and particular and is as such very suitable for this kind of transformation from relevant to creative.
Pataphysics can provide some useful techniques that are very suitable for creative computing.

The aim of this project, in simple words, is to design a tool for creative searching on the Web. It tries to create a fresh way of searching and navigating through information and content on the Internet, to bring back some of the inspirational chance encounters that were so characteristic for libraries.

The tool will challenge the way we understand data and metadata and suggest new meanings between them in accordance with the underlying philosophy. The way we think about information is redefined. It will create new standards or rather get rid of all previous standards and classifications. It will create new links and connections between pieces of information that are not simply based on keyword similarities but rather a more poetic sense of unity. It will be a refreshing new view compared to the structured and standardised thinking of computer scientists. It will challenge the binary logic that dominates the world of programmers and concentrate on what they would view as an illogical and unstructured system going against all standards.

Jorge Luis Borges "Chinese Encyclopaedia' \citep{Borges2000} illustrates this idea very well. The encyclopaedia lists the following results under the category of "animal'.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item those that belong to the Emperor,
  \item embalmed ones,
  \item those that are trained,
  \item suckling pigs,
  \item mermaids,
  \item fabulous ones,
  \item stray dogs,
  \item those included in the present classification,
  \item those that tremble as if they were mad,
  \item innumerable ones,
  \item those drawn with a very fine camelhair brush,
  \item others,
  \item those that have just broken a flower vase,
  \item those that from a long way off look like flies.
\end{enumerate}

Although these are all perfectly valid results, it is clear that they form a more creative, even poetic, view of what an animal might be than the Oxford English Dictionary's prosaic: "a living organism which feeds on organic matter".

\subsection{Syzygy Surfer}

The research presented here is built on the initial ideas of Jim Hendler and Andrew Hugill's "Syzygy Surfer" \citep{Hendler2011, Hendler2013}. They first suggested the use of three pataphysical principles, namely clinamen, syzygy and anomaly, to create a new type of Web search engine, reminiscent of the experience of "surfing the Web". This is in contrast to current search engines which value relevant results over creative ones. "Surfing" used to be a creative interaction between a user and the web of information on the Internet, but the regular use of modern search engines has changed our expectations of this sort of knowledge acquisition. It has drifted away from a learning process by exploring the Web to a straightforward process of information retrieval similar to looking up a word in a dictionary.

\begin{quote}
  "The ambiguity of experience is the hallmark of creativity, that is captured in the essence of pataphysics. Traversing the representations of this ambiguity using algorithms inspired by the syzygy, clinamen and anomaly of pataphysics, using a panalogical mechanism applied to metadata, should be able to humanize and even poeticize the experience of searching the Web." \citep{Hendler2013}
\end{quote}

Their inspirations come from Borges' "Chinese Encyclopaedia" \citep{Borges2000} (for the underlying poetic sense of unity), Jarry's Pataphysics \citep{Jarry1996} (for the concept of patadata – data beyond metadata) and  panalogies (parallel analogies – to introduce ambiguity, since it allows various descriptions of the same object) as formulated by Singh \citep{Singh2005}.

\subsection{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How can we make a search tool that is inspirational rather than informational?
  \item How can we get search results that are unexpected and yet make sense?
  \item How can we rank search results but still be true to Pataphysics philosophy?
  \item How can we represent and structure data to reflect its context, meaning and subjectivity?
  \item How can we present search results in a creative and pataphysical way?
  \item How does Pataphysics relate to creative computing?
  \item How can we use Pataphysics as inspiration for search ranking?
  \item How can we write a specifically creative algorithm?
  \item How can Semantic Web technologies help with the representation of patadata?
  \item What does it mean for search results to be creative/relevant?
  \item Can computers be creative?
  \item What does it actually mean to be creative even for a human being, etc
  \item Is pataphysics creative?
  \item What is a relevant search result?
  \item Is creativity irrelevant?
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

This project combines research in science and art. It is an interdisciplinary research project.

This project has roots in disciplines such as Computer Science and Humanities.
\begin{description}
  \item [Information Retrieval]: Software Engineering, Semantic Web
  \item [Pataphysics]: Literature, Philosophy, Ontology
  \item [Creativity]: Cognitive Science, Artificial Intelligence
\end{description}

In regards to my project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A concept implementation method is used with a descriptive-other approach
  \item A qualitative investigation into if and why the proposed search results are useful will be done
  \item Following experimental methodologies, to evaluate the proposed new solution to the problem of creative search
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
  \item [Epistemology]: Subjective/Argumentative
  \item [Methodology]: Experimental, Interpretative, Qualitative
  \item [Methods]: Concept implementation, (Heuristic) Evaluation
\end{description}

\section{Deliverables / Outcomes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Design a tool for creative searching on the Web
  \item Design pataphysics inspired algorithms to model creativity in this tool
  \item Produce a proof-of-concept prototype
  \item Propose a framework for evaluating and interpreting creative search results
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contribution to Knowledge}

Compared to the mainstream search engines available publicly, my project's approach to searching will be very different. Google, for example, ranks web pages based on the number and quality of incoming hyperlinks \citep{Google2012}, while I will be using the concept of patadata (data-metadata-patadata) and semantic web technologies.

There have been interdisciplinary projects like Johanna Drucker's Speclab \citep{Drucker2009} which have similar inspirations, and literature on Pataphysics is found in several places \citep{Bok2002, Hugill2012a} although the idea of using it as an inspiration for a search engine appears to be very new \citep{Hendler2013}.

A lot of literature exists on how to model creativity on a computer [5] [7], explaining several theories on how the mind works and how to simulate this on a machine. However none of these have any kind of pataphysical inspiration and aren't applicable to search engines, so we have presented a paper on creativity in search results just recently \citep{Raczinski2013}.
