<p><span><strong>Algorithmic Meta-Creativity</strong></span> — Fania Raczinski — Abstract<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Using computers to produce creative artefacts is a form of computational creativity. Using creative techniques computationally is creative computing. <span data-acronym-label="AMC" data-acronym-form="singular+short">AMC</span> spans the two—whether this is to achieve a creative or non-creative output. Creativity in humans needs to be interpreted differently to machines. Humans and machines differ in many ways, we have different ‘brains/memory’, ‘thinking processes/software’ and ‘bodies/hardware’. Often creative output by machines is judged in human terms. Computers which are truly artificially intelligent might be capable of true artificial creativity. Until then, they are (philosophical) zombie robots: machines that behave like humans but aren’t conscious. The only alternative is to see any computer creativity as a direct or indirect expression of human creativity using digital means and evaluate it as such. <span data-acronym-label="AMC" data-acronym-form="singular+short">AMC</span> is neither machine creativity nor human creativity—it is both. By acknowledging the undeniable link between computer creativity and its human influence (the machine is just a tool for the human) we enter a new realm of thought. How is <span data-acronym-label="AMC" data-acronym-form="singular+short">AMC</span> defined and evaluated? This thesis addresses this issue. First <span data-acronym-label="AMC" data-acronym-form="singular+short">AMC</span> is embodied in an artefact (a pataphysical search tool: <a href="pata.physics.wtf">pata.physics.wtf</a>) and then a theoretical framework to help interpret and evaluate such products of <span data-acronym-label="AMC" data-acronym-form="singular+short">AMC</span> is explained.</p>
