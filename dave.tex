Horizon 2012-2013 2 the creative brain: How insight works

Rex Jung, university of New Mexico, on Venice beach, creativity test with a brick - his findings are that less white matter (the fibres throughout the brain) In creative people slows processing down, so that connections can be more random. Has termed the phrase 'transient hypo-frontality, where the frontal lobes above the eyes are less dominant

After coming up with uses for the brick, there are 2 minutes when they're given one of three tasks, then asked to suggest more new uses for the brick, with the following results:
- do nothing (okay)
- do an undemanding task (do best)
- do a demanding task (do worst)
