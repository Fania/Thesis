<p>Creativity does not have a universally accepted definition. Creativity is a human quality and definitions don’t necessarily lend themselves to be applied to computers as well. There are aspects that come up often, like novelty and value, but some that rarely pop up, like relevance and variety. Creativity can be studied at various ‘levels’ (neurological, cognitive, and holistic/systemic), from different ‘perspectives’ (subjective and objective) and ‘characteristics’ (combinational, exploratory and transformative). Creativity should be seen as a continuum, there is no clear cut-off point or Boolean answer to say precisely when a person or piece of software has become creative or not.</p>

<p>This chapter introduces relevant models of human and computer creativity and describes the disciplines of computational creativity and creative computing.</p>

<section id="s:humancreativity" class="level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> In Humans</h2>
<p>Creativity is usually defined as <em>the ability to use original ideas to create something new and surprising of value</em>. We generally speak of creative ‘ideas’ rather than products, since creative products merely provide evidence of a creative process that has already taken place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creativity is the interaction among aptitude, process, and environment by which an individual or group produces a perceptible product that is both novel and useful as defined within a social context</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Jordanous2012">(Plucker et al, as cited in Jordanous and Keller <a href="#ref-Jordanous2012">2012</a>)</span>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.1</span> Four Stages</h3>
<p>Henri Poincar<span>é</span> and Graham Wallas have defined a popular model of the creative process (it was suggested by Poincar<span>é</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="Poincare2001">(<a href="#ref-Poincare2001">2001</a>)</span> and formulated by Wallas <span class="citation" data-cites="Wallas1926">(<a href="#ref-Wallas1926">1926</a>)</span>). This model has been picked up by many researchers since, including <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003 Koestler1964 Partridge1994">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>; Koestler <a href="#ref-Koestler1964">1964</a>; Partridge and Rowe <a href="#ref-Partridge1994">1994</a>)</span>.</p>

<p>Weisberg, however, criticises the stages of incubation and illumination <span class="citation" data-cites="Partridge1994">(as cited in Partridge and Rowe <a href="#ref-Partridge1994">1994</a>)</span>, saying that the creative process is really just simple problem solving, and that incubation is what he calls ‘creative worrying’.

<blockquote>
<p>First, we have to <strong>understand</strong> the problem; we have to see clearly what is required. Second, we have to see how the various items are connected, how the unknown is linked to the data, in order to obtain the idea of the solution, to make a <strong>plan</strong>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.4</span> Four Types</h3>
<p>Sternberg and Kaufman identified a set of personality traits that are associated with creative people in their <em>Handbook of Creativity</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Sternberg1999">(<a href="#ref-Sternberg1999">1999</a>)</span>. These are: independence of judgement, self-confidence, and attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and tolerance for ambiguity, openness to experience, psychoticism, risk taking, androgyny, perfectionism, persistence, resilience, and self-efficacy. It is easy to find common characteristics among creative people but that doesn’t mean that these automatically make a person or a product creative.</p>
<p>Timothy Leary took this idea of common characteristics a bit further and suggested there are four types of creative personalities <span class="citation" data-cites="Leary1964">(<a href="#ref-Leary1964">1964</a>)</span>.

<section id="s:koestler" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.5</span> Three Domains</h3>
<p>Arthur Koestler published his study on creativity entitled <em>The Act of Creation</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Koestler1964">(<a href="#ref-Koestler1964">1964</a>)</span>. His main contribution to the field is probably the concept of ‘bisociation’, a term he coined for the idea of two “self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference” intersecting to give rise to new creative ideas <span class="citation" data-cites="Koestler1964">(<a href="#ref-Koestler1964">1964</a>)</span>. It is interesting however to look at some of his other views on creativity as well.</p>
<p>He splits creativity into three domains—a triptych—without sharp boundaries: humour, discovery and art (see table <a href="#tab:5.1">5.1</a>). All creative acts traverse the three domains of this triptych from left to right, that is, the emotional climate of the creator changes “from an absurd through an abstract to a tragic or lyric view of existence” during the process <span class="citation" data-cites="Koestler1964">(<a href="#ref-Koestler1964">1964</a>)</span>. Central to all three domains is the “discovery of hidden similarities”, or bisociation. Koestler differentiates between associative thinking and bisociative thinking. He links those broadly to habit and originality, respectively. More specifically, associative thinking is conscious, logical, habitual, rigid, repetitive and conservative and bisociative thinking is unconscious, intuitive, original, flexible, novel and destructive/constructive.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.6</span> Three Processes</h3>
<p>Margaret Boden is often cited in the fields of and computational creativity. Her main interest is in how the human mind works and how computer models of the mind and specific thinking processes can help us understand both better. She has provided two important contributions to the field. The first is her description of three distinct forms of creativity describes in this section and the second is her important distinction between two senses of creativity as described in section [s:pandh] <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Creativity is] the ability to come up with ideas or artefacts that are <strong>new, surprising and valuable</strong>.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>, her emphasis)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>She identified three distinct forms or cognitive processes of how creativity can happen. These are combinational, exploratory and transformational creativity, which can happen at the same time <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<dl class="defaultDL">
<dt>Combinational creativity</dt>
<dd><p>making unfamiliar combinations of familiar ideas; juxtaposition of dissimilar; bisociation; deconceptualisation</p>
</dd>
<dt>Exploratory creativity</dt>
<dd><p>exploration of conceptual spaces; noticing new things in old spaces</p>
</dd>
<dt>Transformative creativity</dt>
<dd><p>transformation of space; making new thoughts possible by altering the rules of old conceptual space</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Central to these three forms is the idea of a ‘conceptual space’. For any idea, its conceptual space describes the characteristics and constraints that define it in its most fundamental way. The conceptual space of a tea cup would contain information like: it is a container that can hold a hot fluid, it should hold about a half a pint of fluid and it might or might not be built in such a way as to not burn the hand that carries it. The specific colour of the cup or what material it is made of for example are not contained in its conceptual space.</p>
<p>Combinational creativity is the most common form of the three and is concerned with the unusual juxtaposition of common ideas. This aspect is highlighted in her definition of creativity, which requires novelty and surprise. The main idea is that any particular combination of ideas has to be unusual, causing surprise, but not (necessarily) the individual ideas themselves. She safeguards against purely random combination by including the usefulness of the result as a requirement in the definition. Exploratory creativity requires a person (or computer program) to fully explore the conceptual space of an idea and find unusual or interesting aspects of it. This form of creativity is about pushing an idea to its limits. Transformational creativity takes this exploration one step further. Once the limits of an idea have been identified, they can be transformed. This means that we can step out of the normal conceptual space of an idea, create a new one, alter or ignore the given constraints, add new ones, etc.</p>
<p>Boden argues that creative ideas are surprising because they go against expectations <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(<a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>. She also believes that constraints support creativity and are even essential for it to happen, which echos the OULIPO philosophy mentioned in chapter <a href="pataphysics.html#s:patalipo">4.3.1</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Constraints map out a territory of structural possibilities which can then be explored, and perhaps transformed to give another one.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Bipin Indurkhya argues that there are two main cognitive mechanisms of creativity: namely juxtaposition of dissimilar and deconceptualisation. He says that we are constrained by associations of our concept networks that we inherit and learn in our lifetime, but that computers do not have those conceptual associations and have therefore an advantage when it comes to creative thinking <span class="citation" data-cites="Indurkhya1997">(<a href="#ref-Indurkhya1997">1997</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>

<section id="s:pandh" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.1.7</span> Two Levels</h3>
<p>The three processes of creativity mentioned in the previous section can be then interpreted on two levels <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>. Any idea should be viewed and evaluated at the appropriate level. Consider the following scenario. A child and a professional architect both build a corbeled arch out of material available to them. Who is being creative here? The level of expertise is clearly different between the two. The child has no experience and is experimenting with the possibilities and limitations of the building blocks (exploring their conceptual space) while the architect has studied the technique for years and is simply applying knowledge he has learned from others (familiar use of a familiar idea). Clearly the child is being more creative in this example. Boden proposed to view and judge the creativity of these two persons separately by differentiating between two levels of creativity, a personal one and a historical one.</p>
<p>‘Psychological creativity’ (P-creativity) is a personal kind of creativity that is novel in respect to an individual and ‘historical creativity’ (H-creativity) is fundamentally novel in respect to the whole of human history <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The child in the earlier scenario was P-creative but the architect was neither, he was simply applying his trained skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>P–creativity involves coming up with a surprising, valuable idea that’s new to the person who comes up with it. It doesn’t matter how many people have had that idea before. But if a new idea is H–creative, that means that (so far as we know) no one else has had it before: it has arisen for the first time in human history.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>

<section id="s:compcreativity" class="level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> In Computers</h2>
<p>This section introduces some models that try to implement creative thinking models in computers. It is really just a survey of different concepts and views and does not immediately apply to my specific research on creative search tools.</p>
<p>Partridge and Rowe conducted a survey of computational models of creativity in their book <em>Computers and Creativity</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Partridge1994">(<a href="#ref-Partridge1994">1994</a>)</span>. They mention the computer as an unbiased<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> medium for executing creative programs. Some of the computational methodologies they discussed are as follows, many taken from classical AI research. These are: generative grammars, discovery programs, rule based systems, meta-rules (which reason about and create new rules), analogical mechanisms, flexible representations, classifier systems, decentralised systems, connectionist systems, neural networks, and emergent memory models. Classifier systems for example, consist of a set of rules and a message list as shown below.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Place input messages on current message list.</p></li>
<li><p>Find all rules that can match messages.</p></li>
<li><p>Each such rule generates a message for the new message list.</p></li>
<li><p>Replace current message list with the new one.</p></li>
<li><p>Process new list for any system output.</p></li>
<li><p>Return to step 1.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These can easily be combined with genetic algorithms to enable the system to learn an appropriate classifier set. This is called emergent behavior. Another approach is connectionism also known as neural networks. Partridge and Rowe then go on to describe their emergent-memory model. They are applying the ideas of Poincar<span>é</span> and Wallas <span class="citation" data-cites="Poincare2001 Wallas1926">(Poincaré <a href="#ref-Poincare2001">2001</a>; Wallas <a href="#ref-Wallas1926">1926</a>)</span> and are heavily influence by Minsky’s theory of K-lines <span class="citation" data-cites="Minsky1980 Minsky1988">(<a href="#ref-Minsky1980">1980</a>; <a href="#ref-Minsky1988">1988</a>)</span>. They define the following characteristics for creative programs:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>flexible knowledge representation scheme</p></li>
<li><p>representational imprecision</p></li>
<li><p>multiple representations</p></li>
<li><p>self-assessment</p></li>
<li><p>full elaboration</p></li>
</ul>

<img class="triplespiral" src="../images/triplespiral.png">

<p>Gelernter introduced a theory of how the human mind works called the ‘spectrum model’ <span class="citation" data-cites="Gelernter1994">(<a href="#ref-Gelernter1994">1994</a>)</span>. It is based on the idea of mental focus and relates well to creativity. According to him we have a thought spectrum. The higher the mental focus, the more awake we are, the more adult we are and modern, logical and rational, convergent, abstract and detailed. The less focused we are the younger or ancient or dreaming we are. Low focus thoughts are metaphoric, hallucinations, divergent, creative, inspirations, concrete, ambient and emotional. Emotions glue low focus thoughts together.</p>
<p>He gives a good example of his own computer program that is being trained by a set of simple pairs (or memories) in the form <strong>mood: happy</strong> for example. These sets of pairs form the experience of the system, the memory that the system can access. It’s fetching all memory pairs that match a certain probe, then generalizes them and picks out a feature that is common to all and then uses that to probe further if necessary.</p>
<p>He models his spectrum concept in a way that if we want the system to operate at low focus, more memory pairs would be fetched and more generalised features are deducted and so on. He describes his FGP program (Fetch Generalise Project) as follows <span class="citation" data-cites="Gelernter1994">(Gelernter <a href="#ref-Gelernter1994">1994</a>)</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Fetch memory pairs in response to a probe (question).</p></li>
<li><p>Sandwich them together and peer through the bundle at once.</p></li>
<li><p>Notice the common features that emerge strongly (generalise).</p></li>
<li><p>Pick out interesting emergent details and probe further if necessary.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With low focus the system would not generalise as much and just pick out a particular memory, etc. The computer system Gelernter has built seems very limited. His memory pairs cannot describe everything. For example they can describe states but not actions.</p>
<p>This idea of accessing thoughts/memories is very closely related to searching. Searching an index in a search engine is similar to remembering, trying to find all memories related to the current thought for example.</p>

<img class="triplespiral" src="../images/triplespiral.png">

<p>Minsky introduced the concepts of K-lines in his <em>Society of Mind</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Minsky1980 Minsky1988">(Minsky <a href="#ref-Minsky1980">1980</a>; <a href="#ref-Minsky1988">1988</a>)</span>. It is basically a theory of memory. He claims that the “function of a memory is to recreate a state of mind”. His theory of k-lines is as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you get an idea, or solve a problem, or have a memorable experience, you create what we shall call a K-line. This K-line gets connected to those mental agencies that were actively involved in the memorable mental event. When that K-line is later activated, it reactivates some of those mental agencies, creating a partial mental state resembling the original.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Minsky1980 Minsky1988">(<a href="#ref-Minsky1980">1980</a>; <a href="#ref-Minsky1988">1988</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>This theory works quite well with Gelernter’s idea of memory. K-lines in this sense are nothing other than Gelernter’s memory pairs.</p>
<p>Minsky and his student Push Singh have formalised the idea of a panalogy<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. The idea is that an idea can and should be conceptualised in many different ways. This could be seen as a fall-back mechanism for computational models, if one approach didn’t return the desired/expected results.</p>

<p>Elton explains the concept of ‘artificial creativity’ which can be seen as a sub-area of AI. AI research isn’t ‘human’ enough, he argues, it needs to include less abstract ideas like emotions, morals, aesthetic sensibility and creativity. He goes on to explain in detail how production, evaluation and etiology play a role in everything <span class="citation" data-cites="Elton1995">(Elton <a href="#ref-Elton1995">1995</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Opposed to the traditional approach of AI to study some aspect of the human brain in a specific domain only, he argues that in order to understand creativity we need to look at more than that. Creativity arises from a process that is not isolated. The etiology (its history) is essential for something to be classed as creative. Generation (of artefacts or ideas) cannot count as creative if it doesn’t undergo evaluation in the process. In order to evaluate we need a sound knowledge of the relevant domain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We want creative evaluation to be influenced by a longstanding history of interaction with entities (of whatever kind) in the world.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Elton1995">(Elton <a href="#ref-Elton1995">1995</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Computer systems can be seen in two perspectives: plastic and implastic (resettable). Elton argues that “all systems can be seen from the implastic perspective since ultimately all systems are built out of physical components that are (statically) well behaved, but for certain explanatory purposes some are best understood plastically” <span class="citation" data-cites="Elton1995">(<a href="#ref-Elton1995">1995</a>)</span>. Connectionist networks are an example of a plastic system. The brain is a plastic system too.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> In Academia</h2>
<p>Two transdisciplinary fields of study have emerged from the variety of disciplines concerned. These are computational creativity and creative computing. The former lies at the cross section of AI and cognitive science and is about achieving creativity through computation and the latter is mostly distinguished by its involvement in art and is about doing computations in a creative way. Creative computing focuses on the process of creativity and ‘tacit knowledge’ rather than just the outcome as is more often the case in computational creativity. There is also an area called speculative computing discussed later on.</p>
<p>The concept of creative computing has existed for some time but is only just starting to evolve into a recognised mainstream discipline within computer science. As of 2016, there is a journal <span class="citation" data-cites="IJoCCnd">(“International Journal of Creative Computing” n.d.)</span>, conference <span class="citation" data-cites="ISCC2016">(“International Symposium on Creative Computing” n.d.)</span> and several undergraduate courses dedicated to creative computing<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. Computational creativity, on the other hand, has emerged as a field within AI research and overlaps with creative computing ideas to some extent. There’s also a conference <span class="citation" data-cites="ICCC2017">(“International Conference on Computational Creativity” n.d.)</span>, which has been going for several years.</p>
<p>Perhaps a good example of creative computing is the International Obfuscated C Code Contest <span class="citation" data-cites="Broukhis">(Broukhis, Cooper, and Noll n.d.)</span>. The competition revolves around writing compilable/runnable code, while visually appearing as obfuscated as possible. They value unusuality, obscurity and creativity but expect contestants to follow the strict rules and constraints of the C programming language. Obfuscation in itself isn’t necessarily the hallmark of creative computing but it is one possible use-case. See the example competition entry by <a href="inspirations.html#fig:2.4">Uri Goren</a>.</p>
<p>Examples of computational creativity are Simon Colton’s <em>Painting Fool</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Coltonnd">(n.d.)</span> or Harold Cohen’s <em>AARON</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="kurzweilcyberartnd">(“Learn About Aaron’s History” n.d.)</span>; both are computer programs that paint pictures. Kurzweil’s <em>Cybernetic Poet</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="kurzweilcyberart2001">(“Ray Kurzweil’s Cybernetic Poet” <a href="#ref-kurzweilcyberart2001">2001</a>)</span> is a classic example of a program that produces poetry.</p>

<img class="triplespiral" src="../images/triplespiral.png">

<p>But how may we apply the insights into creativity described in chapter <a href="#s:humancreativity">5.1</a> to computing? One approach is described by Simon Colton <span class="citation" data-cites="Colton2008">(<a href="#ref-Colton2008">2008</a>)</span>, who suggests we should adopt human skill, appreciation and imagination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Without skill, they would never produce anything. Without appreciation, they would produce things which looked awful. Without imagination, everything they produced would look the same.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Colton2008">(Colton <a href="#ref-Colton2008">2008</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>He thinks that evaluating the worth of an idea or product is the biggest challenge facing computational creativity. Whereas in conventional problem solving success is defined as finding a solution, in a creative context more aesthetic considerations have to be taken into account.</p>

<section id="s:compcrea" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.1</span> Computational Creativity</h3>
<p>Computational creativity is a relatively new discipline and as such not well defined. Simon Colton, the creator of the <em>Painting Fool</em>, describes it as the discipline of generating artefacts of real value to someone <span class="citation" data-cites="Colton2008">(<a href="#ref-Colton2008">2008</a>)</span>. This is in contrast to classic AI problem solving.</p>
<p>One could say that computational creativity is the attempt at giving computers the skills, appreciation and imagination needed to produce creative artefacts. Whether or not this makes the computer creative, or the programmer, is another question that I will address in chapter [ch:interpretation].</p>
<p>Computational creativity has emerged from within AI research. Simon Colton and Geraint Wiggins argue AI falls within a problem solving paradigm: “an intelligent task, that we desire to automate, is formulated as a particular type of problem to be solved” <span class="citation" data-cites="Colton2012">(<a href="#ref-Colton2012">2012</a>)</span>, whereas “in Computational Creativity research, we prefer to work within an artefact generation paradigm, where the automation of an intelligent task is seen as an opportunity to produce something of cultural value” <span class="citation" data-cites="Colton2012">(<a href="#ref-Colton2012">2012</a>)</span>. Hugill and Yang on the other hand argue its role within computer science falls under the scientific paradigm <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(<a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span>, <span class="citation" data-cites="Eden2007">(see also Eden <a href="#ref-Eden2007">2007</a>)</span>, as opposed to Creative Computing (CC) in the technocratic paradigm.</p>
<p>The promotes International Association for Computational Creativity (ACC) the advancement of computational creativity which they define as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Computational Creativity is the art, science, philosophy and engineering of computational systems which, by taking on particular responsibilities, exhibit behaviours that unbiased observers would deem to be creative.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="ICCC3014">(ICCC <a href="#ref-ICCC3014">2014</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Computational creativity is multidisciplinary, bringing together researchers from AI, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and the arts. Its main goal is to model, simulate or replicate human creativity using a computer and it has the following three aims:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to construct a program or computer capable of human-level creativity</p></li>
<li><p>to better understand human creativity and to formulate an algorithmic perspective on creative behavior in humans</p></li>
<li><p>to design programs that can enhance human creativity without necessarily being creative themselves</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The ACC manages the annual International Conference on Computational Creativity
(ICCC), whose recent call for papers (for ICCC 2014) gives a useful insight into their research agenda. It can be broken down as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Paradigms, metrics, frameworks, formalisms, methodologies, perspectives</p></li>
<li><p>Computational creativity-support tools</p></li>
<li><p>Creativity-oriented computing in education</p></li>
<li><p>Domain-specific vs. generalised creativity</p></li>
<li><p>Process vs. product</p></li>
<li><p>Domain advancement vs. creativity advancement</p></li>
<li><p>Black box vs. accountable systems</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Simon Colton and Geraint Wiggins have also identified several directions for future research in the field <span class="citation" data-cites="Colton2012">(<a href="#ref-Colton2012">2012</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Continued integration of systems to increase their creative potential.</p></li>
<li><p>Usage of web resources as source material and conceptual inspiration for creative acts by computer.</p></li>
<li><p>Using crowd sourcing and collaborative creative technologies bringing together evaluation methodologies based on product, process, intentionality and the framing of creative acts by software.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.2</span> Creative Computing</h3>
<p>In the recent first issue of the International Journal of Creative Computing
(IJCrC) Hugill and Yang introduced Creative Computing (CC) formally as a new discipline <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(<a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span> with an overarching theme of ‘unite and conquer’ <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang2013">(Yang <a href="#ref-Yang2013">2013</a>)</span>. Its broad aim is to “reconcile the objective precision of computer systems (mathesis) with the subjective ambiguity of human creativity (aesthesis)” <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(Hugill and Yang <a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span>. Hugill and Yang suggest CC falls within the technocratic paradigm of computing <span class="citation" data-cites="Eden2007">(Eden <a href="#ref-Eden2007">2007</a> see also)</span>, i.e. the discipline is closest related to software engineering, rather than mathematics or natural sciences. They identify five main topics for CC research <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(<a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span>:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Challenges</dt>
<dd><p>transdisciplinarity, cross-compatibility, continuity and adaptivity</p>
</dd>
<dt>Types</dt>
<dd><p>creative development of a CC product, development of a product and development of tool for creativity support</p>
</dd>
<dt>Mechanisms</dt>
<dd><p>Boden’s combinational, exploratory and transformational creativity</p>
</dd>
<dt>Methods</dt>
<dd><p>development of suitable transdisciplinary CC research methodologies</p>
</dd>
<dt>Standards</dt>
<dd><p>resist standardisation, novel, continuous user interaction, creative mechanisms</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The main challenge is for technology to become “more adaptive, smarter and better engineered to cope with frequent changes of direction, inconsistencies, irrelevancies, messiness and all the other vagaries that characterise the creative process” <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(Hugill and Yang <a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span>. In part, these issues are due to the transdisciplinary nature of the field and factors such as common semantics, standards, requirements and expectations are typical challenges. Hugill and Yang therefore argue that creative software should be flexible and able to adapt to ever changing requirements, it should be evaluated and re-written continuously and it should be cross-compatible.</p>
<p>The different types of CC highlight the different aspects researchers and practitioners focus on during their work. These are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Process</dt>
<dd><p>creative development of a computing product,</p>
</dd>
<dt>Product</dt>
<dd><p>development of a Creative Computing product and</p>
</dd>
<dt>Community</dt>
<dd><p>development of computing environment to support creativity.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The creative computing process should consist of combinational, exploratory and transformational activities (in the sense of Margaret Boden’s theory, as discussed in section <a href="#s:boden">5.1.6</a>).</p>
<p>Broadly speaking, you could say that the ‘process’ approach works bottom-up and the ‘product’ approach works top-down.</p>
<p>The ‘community’ approach reflects what Hugill and Yang call the “local and global levels”, which represent the two types of creativity identified by Boden (P- and H-creativity). It is concerned with developing environments, tools and methods and the management of these. Cross-compatibilty can be seen as the solution to these personal/local and historical/global issues.</p>
<p>Similar to the four step model of the creative process by Poincare and Wallas <span class="citation" data-cites="Poincare2001 Wallas1926">(<a href="#ref-Poincare2001">2001</a>; <a href="#ref-Wallas1926">1926</a>)</span> and the four stage model of problem solving by P<span>ó</span>lya <span class="citation" data-cites="Polya1957">(<a href="#ref-Polya1957">1957</a>)</span>, Hugill and Yang propose a four step model for the creative computing process. They do this by comparing the acts of artistic creation and software engineering in some detail. They found that the two processes follow essentially the same levels of abstraction (from the abstract to the concrete) <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(<a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Motivation (digitised thinking)</p></li>
<li><p>Ideation (design sketch)</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation (creative system)</p></li>
<li><p>Operation (effect of system/revision)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The similarity to other creativity models is further discussed in chapter [s:models].</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.3</span> Speculative Computing</h3>
<p><em>SpecLab</em> is a book by Johanna Drucker <span class="citation" data-cites="Drucker2009">(<a href="#ref-Drucker2009">2009</a>)</span> about her experiences as a researcher moving between disciplines and the projects she worked on as part of the DH laboratory at the University of Virginia, USA. Several of those projects had pataphysical inspirations.</p>
<p>In his review on the back cover of the book, John Unsworth says that Drucker “emphasizes the graphical over the textual, the generative over the descriptive, and aesthetic subjectivity over analytical objectivism” <span class="citation" data-cites="Drucker2009">(<a href="#ref-Drucker2009">2009</a>)</span>. Her main argument is that in the design of digital knowledge representation, subjectivity and aesthetics are an essential feature. She confronts logical computation with aesthetic principles with the idea that design is information.</p>
<p>Aesthesis is the theory of ambiguous and subjective knowledge, ideological and epistemological, while mathesis is formal objective logic and they contrast each other. Knowledge is always interpretation and subjectivity is always in opposition to objectivity. Knowledge becomes synonymous with information and as such can be represented digitally as data and metadata.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arguably, few other textual forms will have greater impact on the way we read,receive, search, access, use and engage with the primary materials of humanities studies than the metadata structures that organize and present that knowledge in digital form.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Drucker2009">(Drucker <a href="#ref-Drucker2009">2009</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>But how is this metadata analysed? How do we analyse this type of structured data? And most important of all, she asks, what can be considered as data, what can be expressed in those quantitative terms or other standard parameters? Is data neutral, raw or does it have meaning? Here she also points out that many information structures have graphical analogies and can be understood as diagrams that organize the relations of elements within the whole.</p>
<p>Because “computational methods rooted in formal logic tend to be granted more authority […] than methods grounded in subjective judgement”, she introduces the discipline of Speculative Computing (SP) as the solution to that problem. The concept can be understood as a criticism of mechanistic, logical approaches that distinguish between subject and object.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Speculative computing takes seriously the destabilization of all categories of entity, identity, object, subject, interactivity, process, or instrument. In short, it rejects mechanistic, instrumental, and formally logical approaches, replacing them with concepts of autopoiesis (contingent interdependency), quantum poetics and emergent systems, heteroglossia, indeterminacy and potentiality, intersubjectivity, and deformance. Digital Humanities is focused on texts, images, meanings, and means. Speculative Computing engages with interpretation and aesthetic provocation.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Drucker2009">(Drucker <a href="#ref-Drucker2009">2009</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Pataphysics governs exceptions and anomalies and she introduces a, what she calls, ‘patacritical’ method of including those exceptions as rules—even if repeatability and reliability are compromised. Bugs and glitches are privileged over functionality, and although that may not be as useful in all circumstances, they are “valuable to speculation in a substantive, not trivial, sense.” In an essay on SP she says “Pataphysics celebrates the idiosyncratic and particular within the world of phenomena, thus providing a framework for an aesthetics of specificity within generative practice” <span class="citation" data-cites="Drucker2007">(Drucker and Nowviskie <a href="#ref-Drucker2007">2007</a>)</span>. To break out of the formal logic and defined parameters of computer science we need speculative capabilities and pataphysics. “The goal of pataphysical and speculative computing is to keep digital humanities from falling into mere technical application of standard practices” <span class="citation" data-cites="Drucker2007">(<a href="#ref-Drucker2007">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math inline">′</span>Pataphysics inverts the scientific method, proceeding from and sustaining exceptions and unique cases, while quantum methods insist on conditions of indeterminacy as that which is intervened in any interpretative act. Dynamic and productive with respect to the subject-object dialectic of perception and cognition, the quantum extensions of speculative aesthetics have implications for applied and theoretical dimensions of computational humanities.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Drucker2007">(Drucker and Nowviskie <a href="#ref-Drucker2007">2007</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>With this, Drucker introduces Speculative Aesthetics, which links interface design with other speculative computing principles. She also refers to Kant and his idea of ‘purposiveness without purpose’. She says that the appreciation of design as it is (outside of utility) is the goal of speculative aesthetics.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.3.4</span> Digital Humanities</h3>
<p>Burdick et al. have written a manifesto for the field of Digital Humanities (DH) <span class="citation" data-cites="Burdick2012">(<a href="#ref-Burdick2012">2012</a>)</span>. Computing has had a big impact on the humanities as a discipline so much so that DH was born of the encounter between the two. In essence, it is characterised by “collaboration, transdisciplinarity and an engagement with computing” but it should not simply be reduced to ‘doing the humanities digitally’ <span class="citation" data-cites="Burdick2012">(<a href="#ref-Burdick2012">2012</a>)</span>. It spans across many traditional areas of research, such as literature, philosophy, history, art, music, design and of course computer science—making the concept of transliteracy fundamental.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Transliteracy is “the ability to read, write and interact across a range of platforms, tools and media from signing and orality through handwriting, print, TV, radio and film, to digital social networks.”</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Thomas2007">(Thomas et al. <a href="#ref-Thomas2007">2007</a>
