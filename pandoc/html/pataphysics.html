<p>It is probably impossible to define pataphysics in one sentence. There is no definition that does justice to what pataphysics really is and no single definition is truer than any other. In fact, the college of pataphysics in France has published a book <span class="citation" data-cites="Brotchie2003">(Brotchie et al. <a href="#ref-Brotchie2003">2003</a>)</span> with over 100 definitions that they all call ‘equally valid’.

<blockquote>
<p>Pataphysics …is the science of that which is superinduced upon metaphysics, whether within or beyond the latter’s limitations, extending as far beyond metaphysics as the latter extends beyond physics. […] Pataphysics will be, above all, the science of the particular, despite the common opinion that the only science is that of the general. Pataphysics will examine the laws governing exceptions, and will explain the universe supplementary to this one.

</blockquote>
<p>Studying Jarry’s life gives certain insights into the man who created pataphysics and why he might have done so. Several works have helped prepare the below outline of Jarry’s life. Alastair Brotchie’s <em>A Pataphysical Life</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Brotchie2011a">(<a href="#ref-Brotchie2011a">2011</a>)</span> and Roger Shattuck’s <em>The Banquet Years</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Shattuck1959">(<a href="#ref-Shattuck1959">1959</a>)</span> were the two main sources used but several others have also written about Alfred Jarry (e.g. Linda Klieger Stillman, Keith Beaumont, and Jill Fell).</p>

<section id="life" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Life</h3>
<p>Alfred Jarry was born in Laval, Mayenne, France in 1873 and died in Paris in 1907, at the age of 34. He was known as a poet, dramatist, novelist and journalist but also as a graphic artist. His hobbies included entomology, fishing, cycling, fencing, shooting and drinking.</p>
<p>He went to school in Rennes, where his physics teachers Félix-Frédéric Hébert left such a big impression on Jarry that he would later be his inspiration for Père Ubu. He passed his baccalauréat with 17 and moved to Paris to attend the lycée Henri IV in preparation to apply for admission to the École Normale Supérieure but eventually gave upon the entrance exam after several unsuccessful attempts. He met another teacher at the lycée, this time a philosophy teacher called Henri Bergson, who inspired him greatly. He published his first collection of poems in 1893, aged 20, the year his mother died. One of his classmates there described him as follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] I found Jarry’s mental processes disturbing. When he let himself go he seemed in thrall to a torrent of words outside his control. It was no longer a person speaking, but a machine controlled by a demon. His staccato voice, metallic and nasal, his abrupt puppet-like gestures, his fixed expression and uncontrolled flood of language, his grotesque and brilliant turns of phrases, ended up provoking a feeling of disquiet. He was informed, intelligent, and discriminating; he was good person, secretly kind, perhaps even shy beneath it all […] but his originality resembled nothing short of a mental anomaly.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Brotchie2011">(Gandilhon Gens-d'Armes 1922, as cited in Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011">2011</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>He was at the centre of the avant-garde movement in Paris around that time, at the centre of the Tuesday meetings of the Mercure de France (a literary magazine run by Alfred Valette and his wife Rachilde, who soon became a sort of substitute family to Jarry who was roughly 15 years younger than them). Being rather misogynist at times and homosexually inclined, Rachilde was one of his very few female friends.</p>
<p>The following year, 1895, he briefly joined the army in the <span class="math inline">101<sup><em>s</em><em>t</em></sup></span> infantry, after having dodged it by being an enrolled student at the lycée. He followed rules there pedantically but hated the loss of his individualism. According to Brotchie, he “chose subservience, but subservience taken to the point of parody: the pataphysical solution to the problem of obedience” <span class="citation" data-cites="Brotchie2011a">(<a href="#ref-Brotchie2011a">2011</a>)</span>. Probably the only thing he enjoyed there was the fencing and shooting training. He looked funny in the uniform that was too big for him being so small (5’3”) so he was eventually excused from parades and after a few months he was allowed to leave to Paris frequently. He was discharged in December 1895 on medical grounds: gallstones. It is not unlikely that he faked the illness by drinking picric acid.</p>
<p>His father had died just two months earlier and had left him a small inheritance, which he spent mostly on publishing his very own magazine dedicated to symbolist wood carvings, the <em>Perhinderion</em>. He had previously co-edited the magazine <em>L’Ymagier</em> with Remy de Gourmont between 1893 and 1894. He joined Aurélien Lugné-Poë as his secretary (his only ever real job) at the <em>Théâtre de l’Œuvre</em> after his discharge at the army, where he would pour his utmost attention to putting his Ubu play on the stage. He also played a small role in the production of <em>Peer Gynt</em> at the <em>Œuvre</em> earlier in 1896. The printed version of <em>Ubu Roi</em> appeared in <em>Le Livre d’Art</em> in the middle of the year with Jarry’s carved woodcut image of Ubu shown in <a href="#img:ubu">Image 4.1</a>. The première took place on <span class="math inline">10<sup><em>t</em><em>h</em></sup></span> December that year and caused an outrage in the audience after the first word: ‘merdre’ (sometimes translated as ‘pshit’). Jarry had previously arranged for certain friends to counter any reaction of the general audience and to prevent under all circumstances for the play to reach its conclusion. The performance went according to plan. The uproar after the first word was uttered was immense, the performance had to be interrupted at times to calm the audience and it finished in shouts of praise, protest and insults. There were no further performances but the event was considered historic even at the time and is now widely seen as the first ‘modern’ play <span class="citation" data-cites="Brotchie2011a">(Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011a">2011</a>)</span>. And as Dave Walsh puts it: “Movements such as Dadaism, Surrealism, Futurism, Expressionism Cubism, Theatre of the Absurd—all owe debts to [Jarry’s] works” <span class="citation" data-cites="Walsh2001">(<a href="#ref-Walsh2001">2001</a>)</span>.</p>

</figure>

<p>Although Ubu’s mannerism of speech was originally imitating Jarry’s, as suggested by Lugné-Poë <span class="citation" data-cites="Brotchie2011a">(Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011a">2011</a>)</span>, Jarry continued to adopt Ubu’s mannerisms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who knew him said that his nauseating appearance hid a youth who was stubborn yet shy, proud and little full of himself, but good-natured and ingenuous behind his cynicism, one who was fiercely independent and rigorously honest.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Brotchie2011">(Henri de Regnier, as cited in Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011">2011</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alfred Jarry had a very particular way of speaking to that was disconcerting to those who heard it for the first time. He said “we”, when referring to himself, and substituted verbs for nouns, in imitation of ancient Greek. Example: “celui qui soufflé” (that which blows) for the wind, and “celui qui se traîne” (that which crawls along) for the train, even if it was an express! This made conversation somewhat complicated, not least because of the rapidity of his delivery.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Brotchie2011">(Rachilde, as cited in Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011">2011</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alfred Jarry was a man of letters to an unprecedented extent. His smallest actions, his childish pranks, everything he did was literature. His whole life was shaped by literature, and only by literature.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Brotchie2011">(Appolinaire, as cited in Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011">2011</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Jarry spent the next few years writing. He had spent all his inheritance on the publication of his magazine and the production of Ubu Roi. It is during this time that he moved to his infamous tiny flat on the second-and-a-half floor. Jarry could just about stand upright but any guests had to crouch. He had no electricity or gas and no means of cooking. In December 1897 he formed a marionette theatre with his friend Claude Terasse: the <em>Théâtre de Pantins</em> and they performed <em>Ubu Roi</em> in January 1898 without riots in the audience.</p>
<p>Jarry then gradually withdrew from the literary circles in Paris and spent more time in a little shack on the banks of the Seine near the village of Le Coudray. He started writing a regular review column for the <em>Revue Blanche</em> in 1900, the income of which he certainly needed much. There was a brief revival of the Ubu marionette play in the <em>Cabaret des Quat’z’Arts</em> in 1901.</p>
<p>Around 1904 he began drinking ether, the absinthe not strong enough anymore. In the winter of 1905 he was very ill, the cold and poverty not helping. In 1906, his friends became more and more concerned about his deteriorating health and eventually Valette and Saltas sent him to his sister Charlotte. He then spent some time in Paris and some in Laval at his sister’s place over the next year. Alfred Jarry then died in November of 1907 of meningeal tuberculosis. His last request was for a toothpick.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He believes that the decomposing brain goes on working after death and it is its dreams that are Paradise.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Brotchie2011">(Jarry 1906, as cited in Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011">2011</a>, the 'he' refers to Jarry himself, he is talking in third person.)</span>

<section id="literature" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> Literature</h3>
<p>Jarry has written a good amount of texts in his short life and he didn’t confine himself to a single category either. He wrote poems, novels, short stories, essays, art reviews, theatre reviews and plays and also produced translations into French. Many of his texts were completely fictional, some had autobiographical and some scientific aspects and most of them had a sarcastic sense of humour. See appendix <a href="random.html#s:jarry">A.6</a> for a full list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Jarry was an acknowledged classical scholar, had already worked as a reviewer of art and drama, had edited two art magazines, was up to date with modern scientific theory, especially physics, read widely in mathematics and psychology, and had an extensive basic knowledge of philosophy.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Brotchie2011">(Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011">2011</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>James Cutshall says that “instead of Jarry the man and the meaning of his literary endeavours becoming clearer with the passage of time, both have become increasingly indistinct” <span class="citation" data-cites="Cutshall1988">(<a href="#ref-Cutshall1988">1988</a>)</span>. He intended to show the seriousness implied behind the humour used in many of Jarry’s novels, in order to give the author the merit he deserved. Cutshall wrote about Jarry’s novels rather than simply seeing him as the playwright of the Ubu plays. He surveyed existing criticism about Jarry’s texts and provided his own view on them. He immortalised Jarry by saying “whether or not this is the sort of ‘éthernité’ sought by the heroes of Jarry’s novels, it is certainly that which their author somewhat belatedly has found” <span class="citation" data-cites="Cutshall1988">(Cutshall <a href="#ref-Cutshall1988">1988</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Cutshall was not the only one who has written about certain less-known texts by Jarry. Marieke Dubbelboer’s thesis <em>Ubusing Culture</em> is also interesting in this regard since it concentrates completely on the <em>Almanachs du Père Ubu</em> (published in 1898 and 1901) <span class="citation" data-cites="Dubbelboer2009">(<a href="#ref-Dubbelboer2009">2009</a>)</span>. She was looking for keys to Jarry’s poetics in those texts, which she says “seemed to defy labelling or literary norms” <span class="citation" data-cites="Dubbelboer2009">(<a href="#ref-Dubbelboer2009">2009</a>)</span>. She claims the <em>Almanachs</em> to be quite radical and exemplary of his innovative poetics moving away from symbolism and towards the avant-garde. In general she says his work “can be characterized as playful, elusive, paradoxical and provocative” <span class="citation" data-cites="Dubbelboer2009">(<a href="#ref-Dubbelboer2009">2009</a>)</span> and his two <em>Almanachs</em> are the essence of his non-conformist attitude. They were written at a time of change for Jarry, when he withdrew from his usual circles in Paris and he published in new magazines.</p>

<section id="self-conscious" class="level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Self-conscious</h2>
<p>We will need to understand the essence of pataphysics to understand how it relates to the other topics of this research.</p>
<p>Jarry first defined pataphysics in his book <em>Exploits and Opinions of Dr Faustroll, Pataphysician</em> written in 1898 and published posthumously in 1911 <span class="citation" data-cites="Jarry1996">(<a href="#ref-Jarry1996">1996</a>)</span>. But the concept appeared as early as in 1893 in his prose text <em>Guignol</em> that won him a prize in the newspaper <em>L’Echo de Paris</em> and it appears in many of his writings. He originally intended to write a whole book called <em>Elements of Pataphysics</em> but only part of this appeared in Faustroll.</p>
<p>Zo<span>ë</span> Corbyn gives a very simple short introduction for beginners of the topic in an article in the <em>Guardian</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Corbyn2005">(<a href="#ref-Corbyn2005">2005</a>)</span>. She describes it like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Correct definitions are equivalent to wrong ones; all religions are on a par as imaginary and equally important; chalk really is cheese. It’s an escape from reality — reminding us of just how idiotic the rules that dog our everyday existence are.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Corbyn2005">(Corbyn <a href="#ref-Corbyn2005">2005</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Jean Baudrillard has a few other definitions for pataphysics <span class="citation" data-cites="Baudrillard2007">(<a href="#ref-Baudrillard2007">2007</a>)</span>. According to him, pataphysics is “the highest temptation of the spirit”, “the nail in the tire”, “the philosophy of the gaseous state”, “the science or the unique imaginary solution to the absence of problems”, to name just a few.</p>
<p>Another rather strange interpretation of pataphysics is Asger Jorn’s. He calls pataphysics “a religion in the making” <span class="citation" data-cites="Jorn1961">(<a href="#ref-Jorn1961">1961</a>)</span>. He claims that since “natural religion is the spiritual confirmation of material existence”, “metaphysical religion represents the establishment of an ever deepening rift between material and spiritual life.” He refers to the idea of equivalence in pataphysics and the absolute and links them to religion. He says “the great merit of Pataphysics is to have confirmed that there is no metaphysical justification for forcing everybody to believe in the same absurdity”.</p>
<p>Cruickshank <span class="citation" data-cites="Cruickshank">(<a href="#ref-Cruickshank">2016</a>)</span> wrote a rather funny article on anti-matter. He links the creation of anti-matter atoms at CERN<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> around 1996 with Jarry, saying that he had “beaten them to the punch” with his pataphysics.</p>
<p>Christian Bök <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span> tries to draw science and poetry together using pataphysics as the string that binds them. He compares Jarry and Nietzsche, saying Jarry performs humorously on behalf of literature what Nietzsche performs seriously on behalf of philosophy; both try to create an anti-philosophy <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>. He also claims that science and poetry have a similar history, undergoing the same four phases of distinct change but also that they have not evolved in sync with each other <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pataphysics is a surrational perspective that has had an extensive, yet forgotten, influence upon the canonic history of radical poetics. […] Not only does this avant-garde pseudoscience valorise whatever is exceptional and paralogical; it also sets the parameters for the contemporary relationships between science and poetry.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Bok2002">(Bok <a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Bök also compares Jarry and Nietzsche in regards to perspectivism <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>. For Nietzsche reality is the effect of a dream world in which “there are many kinds of truths, and consequently there is no truth”. And similarly for Jarry, reality is an aspect of ethernity in which “there are only hallucinations, or perceptions” and every “perception is a hallucination which is true”. Both argue that no view is absolute as well and pataphysics argues that every viewpoint is dissolute, including its own because no view can offer a norm. Even Jarry’s ethernity is nowhere and somewhere at the same time.</p>
<p>In Faustroll, Bök says, “Jarry parodies the discourse of such scientific luminaries, who attempt to demonstrate the utility of science through the dramaturgic performance of a mechanical experiment” <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Regarding the perplexing apostrophe that sometimes appears before the word <span class="math inline">′</span>pataphysics: Jarry only ever used the apostrophe on a single occasion, specifying that he did so “in order to avoid a simple pun”. What that pun might be has never been fully explained. User JBlum of <a href="http://urbandictionary.com" class="uri">urbandictionary.com</a> says: “The exact pun to be avoided is the subject of some debate. The debate itself – being, in essence, a debate about a subject which may not truly exist, but exist as another joke by Jarry – might itself be considered a <span class="math inline">′</span>pataphysical search, for an ‘imaginary solution’ to an imaginary problem!” <span class="citation" data-cites="pataphysics2007">(<a href="#ref-pataphysics2007">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>According to the college of pataphysics, it is convention to use the apostrophe at the beginning of the word only in reference to Jarry’s texts, to the science of imaginary solutions as such. Used as an adjective or in a more unconscious way it is written without the apostrophe.</p>
<section id="symbology" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.1</span> Symbology</h3>
<p>Probably the most famous symbol of pataphysics is the <em>grand gidouille</em>, the big spiral on Ubu’s fat belly—see image <a href="#img:ubu">Image 4.1</a>. Not simply because it is a feature of Jarry’s most popular creation but also because it represents one of the concepts of pataphysics itself: the antimony. The spiral can be interpreted as two spirals in one, the outer and the inner spiral. They represent the duality of pataphysics, the mutually incompatible in perfect harmony. The college of pataphysics has adopted the spiral for its membership badges, in various colours and sizes for the different ranks of the college.</p>
<p>Another symbol of pataphysics is the green candle which refers to one of Jarry’s last endeavours, published posthumously, a vast collection of his journalistic essays <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2012">(Hugill <a href="#ref-Hugill2012">2012</a>)</span>. Some animals also symbolise pataphysics. The college’s vice-curator was a crocodile called Lutembi until 2014 <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2012">(Hugill <a href="#ref-Hugill2012">2012</a>)</span>. Owls are another symbol; Jarry kept stuffed and live owls <span class="citation" data-cites="Brotchie2011a">(Brotchie <a href="#ref-Brotchie2011a">2011</a>)</span> in his flat. The chameleon is another, having the ability to change colour and looking in two directions at the same time.</p>

<section id="s:antinomy" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> Antimony</h3>
<p>The antimony is the mutually incompatible. It appears everywhere in Jarry’s writings. It represents the duality of things, the echo or symmetry, the good and the evil at the same time. Examples are the plus-minus, the faust-troll, the haldern-ablou, the yes-but, the ha-ha and the paradox.</p>
<p>The ‘Ha Ha’, the only words Bosse-da-Nage ever utters in Faustroll, “is the idea of duality, of echo, of distance, of symmetry, of greatness and duration, of the two principles of good and evil.” <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2012">(Hugill <a href="#ref-Hugill2012">2012</a>)</span> Referring to the ‘yes-but’ statement, Hugill says “this may be taken as a standard pataphysical response to any proposition (including this one).” And most obviously the antimony can be seen in all the contradictions that pataphysics is so fond of.</p>

<section id="s:anomaly" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.3</span> Anomaly</h3>
<p>The anomaly is the exception. And exceptions are important in pataphysics. But then again everything is equal, so in a pataphysical world no exceptions would exist at all, or rather, everything would be equally exceptional. The anomaly disrupts and surprises. Hugill mentioned a great example of a collection of anomalies: the sourcebook project by William Corliss <span class="citation" data-cites="Corlissnd">(n.d.)</span>, who collects scientific papers that are anomalous. Bök says it is “the repressed part of a rule which ensure that the rule does not work” <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>
</section>
<section id="s:syzygy" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.4</span> Syzygy</h3>
<p>The syzygy surprises and confuses. It originally comes from astronomy and denotes the alignment of three celestial bodies in a straight line. In a pataphysical context it is the pun, which Jarry called “the syzygy of words” <span class="citation" data-cites="Jarry1996">(<a href="#ref-Jarry1996">1996</a>)</span>. It usually describes a conjunction of things, something unexpected and surprising. Next to being intentionally funny, puns demonstrate a clever use (or abuse) of grammar, syntax, pronunciation and/or semantics, often taken to a quite scientific level, such that without understanding of what is said and what is the intended meaning, the humour of the pun might be lost. Serendipity is a simple chance encounter but the syzygy has a more scientific purpose. Bök mentions Jarry saying that “the fall of a body towards a centre is the same as the ascension of a vacuum towards a periphery” <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>.</p>

</section>
<section id="s:clinamen" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.5</span> Clinamen</h3>
<p>The clinamen is the unpredictable swerve that Bök calls “the smallest possible aberration that can make the greatest possible difference” <span class="citation" data-cites="Bok2002">(<a href="#ref-Bok2002">2002</a>)</span>. He links it to Lucretius idea of an atom swerving in its streamlined flow to create matter and to Epicurus’ parenklisis. But he also points out similarities to ideas like the Situationists’ ‘détournement’, the reuse of pre-existing aesthetic elements and Hugill links it to the Dadaists’ ready-mades and Oulipo’s verbal games <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2012">(<a href="#ref-Hugill2012">2012</a>)</span>. An obvious example is Jarry’s <em>merdre</em>, a swerve of the French word for shit (merde).</p>

</section>
<section id="s:absolute" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.6</span> Absolute</h3>
<p>The absolute is a reference to a transcended reality. Jarry talks about ‘ethernity’ in Faustroll <span class="citation" data-cites="Jarry1996">(<a href="#ref-Jarry1996">1996</a>)</span>.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Ouvroir de Littérature Potentielle (OULIPO) was already introduced in chapter <a href="inspirations.html#s:oulipo">2.7</a> as one of my main inspirations and influences on this research.</p>
<p>The OULIPO is a literary movement from the 1960’s, originating in France as a subcommittee of the “Collège de Pataphysique”. It has since spread to other disciplines. The generic term for Oulipian groups is OUXPO (“Ouvroir d’X Potentielle”), where the X can be replaced with whatever particular subject area you like (typically in french): fine art—OUPEINPO, music—OUMUPO, etc. It has roots in pataphysics although it eventually separated and became a standalone group. Their main philosophy perhaps is to use constraints in order to enhance creative output. Some examples of techniques, taken from <span class="citation" data-cites="Mathews2005">(Mathews and Brotchie <a href="#ref-Mathews2005">2005</a>)</span>, invented and used by them are shown below.</p>
<p>Techniques such as the famous ‘N+7’, ‘melting snowball’ and ‘Mathewś algorithm’ (see chapter <a href="inspirations.html#s:oulipo">2.7</a> and figure <a href="inspirations.html#fig:oulipo">2.2</a>) are typical examples of Oulipian methods. They have endless applications in as many different disciplines. Motte collated a useful overview of the different Oulipian operations <span class="citation" data-cites="Motte2007">(<a href="#ref-Motte2007">2007</a>)</span>, shown here in table <a href="#tab:oulipo1">4.1</a> and table <a href="#tab:oulipo2">4.2</a>.</p>

<p>The Oulipian aesthetic is a paradox— formal constraints afford creative liberty, Motte says <span class="citation" data-cites="Motte2007">(<a href="#ref-Motte2007">2007</a>)</span>. He also explained that “Erecting the aesthetic of formal constraint, then, the Oulipo simultaneously devalues inspiration” <span class="citation" data-cites="Motte2007">(<a href="#ref-Motte2007">2007</a>)</span>. François Le Lionnais defined the following three levels in the hierarchy of constraints <span class="citation" data-cites="Motte2007">(Motte <a href="#ref-Motte2007">2007</a>)</span>. (1) Minimal: constraints on the language in which the text is written, (2) Intermediate: constraints on genre and certain literary norms, and (3) Maximum: consciously preelaborated and voluntarily imposed systems of artifice. The use of constraints combats the aleatory or random.</p>
