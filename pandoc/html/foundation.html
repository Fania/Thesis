<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Exploring Creativity</h2>
<section id="s:models" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.1</span> General Models</h3>
<p>The <a href="creativity.html">Creativity</a> chapter introduced various models of creativity. The present chapter discusses some of their similarities and differences.</p>
<dl class="defaultDL">
<dt>4 P Model</dt>
<dd><p>Mel Rhodes identified four common themes of creativity (Person, Process, Press, Products), which he termed the ‘4 Ps’ of creativity<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>4 Aspects</dt>
<dd><p>Ross Mooney independently identified four aspects of creativity which he called Environment, Person, Process and Product<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>P and H Model</dt>
<dd><p>Margaret Boden defined three types of creativity: combinational, exploratory and transformational and two different ‘levels’ P and H creativity<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>4 C Model</dt>
<dd><p>James Kaufman and Ronald Beghetto defined the ‘4 C’ model of creativity. These are Big-C, Pro-c, Little-c and Mini-c<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Rhodes ‘4 P’ model and Mooney’s ‘4 aspects’ are essentially one and the same. They were published in 1961 and 1963 respectively. The only difference is in the name; Rhodes calls the Mooney’s environment ‘press’, hence the four ‘P’s.</p>

<figure id="fig:8.1">
<img src="../images/fig81.png" alt="Four aspects of creativity">
<figcaption>Figure 8.1 – Four aspects of creativity</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:8.1">8.1</a> shows how these four aspects relate to each other. It’s a hierarchy of influence in a sense. The environment is omnipresent and influences everything else. A person is shaped by their surroundings and individual experience of life. And the particular process a person uses obviously influences the outcome—the product.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Boden argues that process does matter, stating that a program is creative only if it produces items in the right way—by transforming the boundaries of a conceptual space.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Pease2001">(Pease, Winterstein, and Colton <a href="#ref-Pease2001">2001</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Boden and Kaufman overlap in a less obvious way. Boden’s book <em>the Creative Mind</em> was first published in 1990 <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(<a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>, while Kaufman and Beghetto published their paper <em>Beyond Big and Little</em> in 2009 <span class="citation" data-cites="Kaufman2009">(<a href="#ref-Kaufman2009">2009</a>)</span>. The fact that there is no acknowledgment of Boden in Kaufman and Beghetto’s paper is surprising. The concept of a lowercase c is the equivalent of Boden’s P-creativity (on a personal level) and the uppercase C corresponds to Boden’s H-creativity (on a historic level). This also ties in very neatly with the idea of subjectivity and objectivity as table <a href="#tab.8.1">8.1</a> shows.</p>

</figure>

<p>Arguably, the Pro-c should perhaps be called Pro-C instead (with a capital ‘C’), as it takes a certain amount of external validation and accreditation becoming a professional at anything—which goes beyond the personal and private lowercase c in my opinion. Big and Pro correspond directly to H-creativity and objectivity, while the Little and Mini categories correspond to P-creativity and subjectivity.</p>

<section id="creative-process" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.2</span> Creative Process</h3>
<dl class="defaultDL">
<dt>4 Stage Model</dt>
<dd><p>Henri Poincaré suggested a ‘4 Stage Model’ (formulated by Graham Wallas in 1926). The stages are: preparation, incubation, illumination and verification<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Problem Solving</dt>
<dd><p>George Pólya came up with a description of the ‘problem solving’ process<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Looking at table <a href="#tab:8.2">8.2</a> highlights the similarities of the two models above and compares them to the ‘4 P Model’ of creativity from the previous section. Both the 4 Stage Model and the problem solving steps are linear. They’re a sequence of steps followed one after the other. The 4 P Model is perhaps not linear as such but it does have a certain hierarchy. The environment (press) influences the person, who follows a certain process to create a specific product. In table <a href="#tab:8.2">8.2</a> the first two stages happen within the person and environment. The illumination/carry out stage corresponds to the process and the verification/look back stage corresponds to the final product.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.1.3</span> Creative Disciplines</h3>
<p>Initiatives that aim at a more rigorous understanding of computing and creativity have given rise to several fields, each having its own terminology and approach, but with significant overlaps.</p>
<dl class="defaultDL">
<dt>Creative Computing</dt>
<dd><p>Reconcile the objective precision of computer systems with the subjective ambiguity of human creativity. The process is made of 4 steps: motivation, ideation, implementation and operation<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>.</p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p>Creative Computing (CC) (see chapter <a href="creativity.html#s:creacomp">5.3.2</a>) tries to reconcile the objective precision of computer systems with the subjective ambiguity of human creativity <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(Hugill and Yang <a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span> and has an overarching theme of ‘unite and conquer’, i.e. drawing from a wide range of transdisciplinary knowledge to tackle a problem (as opposed to the principle of ‘divide and conquer’ in computer science, which divides bigger problems down into smaller and easier parts) <span class="citation" data-cites="Yang2013">(Yang <a href="#ref-Yang2013">2013</a>)</span>. The main challenge, Hugill and Yang argue, is for technology to become “more adaptive, smarter and better engineered to cope with frequent changes of direction, inconsistencies, irrelevancies, messiness and all the other vagaries that characterise the creative process” <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(<a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span>. In part, these issues are due to the transdisciplinary nature of CC; factors such as common semantics, standards, requirements and expectations are typical challenges. Hugill and Yang therefore argue that creative software should be flexible and able to adapt to ever-changing requirements, evaluated and re-written continuously, and it should be cross-compatible <span class="citation" data-cites="Hugill2013c">(<a href="#ref-Hugill2013c">2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Computational creativity (see chapter <a href="creativity.html#s:compcrea">5.3.1</a>) has emerged from within AI research. Colton and Wiggins argue that AI falls within a problem-solving paradigm: “an intelligent task, that we desire to automate, is formulated as a particular type of problem to be solved”, whereas “in Computational Creativity research, we prefer to work within an artefact generation paradigm, where the automation of an intelligent task is seen as an opportunity to produce something of cultural value” <span class="citation" data-cites="Colton2012">(<a href="#ref-Colton2012">2012</a>)</span>. They further explain that it models, simulates, replicates or enhances human creativity using a computer.</p>
<p>Digital humanities (see chapter <a href="creativity.html#s:digithuman">5.3.4</a>) is the intersection between computing and the humanities. It is characterised by collaboration, transdisciplinarity and computational methods <span class="citation" data-cites="Burdick2012">(Burdick et al. <a href="#ref-Burdick2012">2012</a>)</span>. It spans across many traditional areas of research, such as literature, philosophy, history, art, music, design and of course computer science.</p>

<section id="relating-pataphysics" class="level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Relating Pataphysics</h2>
<p>Pataphysics was introduced in chapter <a href="pataphysics.html">4</a> and this section observes how it relates to creativity and computing.</p>

<section id="to-creativity" class="level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">8.2.1</span> To Creativity</h3>
<p>Let’s define creativity as ‘the ability to use original ideas to create something new and surprising of value’. The creative process normally involves a move from the known to the unknown and sometimes from the named to the unnamed. In bringing something new into existence, the human qualities of openness and tolerance of ambiguity are generally regarded as highly desirable. Both the originality and the value of an idea are evaluated using subjective criteria. Pataphysics, which represents an extreme form of subjectivity, is therefore a highly appropriate framework within which to encourage and enable creative thinking and operations and to enable this kind of transformation from relevant to creative.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ambiguity of experience is the hallmark of creativity, that is captured in the essence of pataphysics.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Hendler2013">(Hendler and Hugill <a href="#ref-Hendler2013">2013</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Boden argues that constraints support creativity, and are even essential for it to happen. She says that “constraints map out a territory of structural possibilities which can then be explored, and perhaps transformed to give another one” <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(<a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>. This echoes the ideas of groups such as the OULIPO (which began as a Sub-Commission of the Collège de <span class="math inline">′</span>Pataphysique), who investigate ‘potential literature’ by creating constraints that frequently have a ludic element. Various other groups, the OU-X-POs, perform similar operations in fields as diverse as cinema, politics, music and cooking <span class="citation" data-cites="Motte2007">(Motte <a href="#ref-Motte2007">2007</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Boden links her three aspects of creativity to three sorts of surprise. She says that creative ideas are surprising because they go against our expectations. “The more expectations are disappointed, the more difficult it is to see the link between old and new” she says <span class="citation" data-cites="Boden2003">(<a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span> This suggests that fewer expectations (an open mind) allow creativity to happen more easily. Empirical experiences form expectations, which hinder our ability to accept creative ideas when they happen. In order to be able to recognise creative ideas we need to be able to see what they all have in common and in what way they differ and not reject unusual, unexpected ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unless someone realizes the structure which old and new spaces have in common, the new idea cannot be seen as the solution to the old problem. Without some appreciation of shared constraints, it cannot even be seen as the solution to a new problem intelligibly connected with the previous one.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Boden2003">(Boden <a href="#ref-Boden2003">2003</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>It is clear that the OULIPO has a similar approach in its theorising of potential literature. Releasing creativity through constraint is its essential raison d’être. This is not to say that experience and knowledge are necessarily bad for creativity. To appreciate creativity we need to be knowledgeable in the relevant domain to be able to recognise old and new connections and transformations. But we also need a certain level of openness and tolerance for ambiguity to overcome our expectations.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is for this reason that ‘creative people’ are often assumed to have particular personality traits (see also chapter <a href="creativity.html#s:personality">5.1.4</a>). Sternberg <span class="citation" data-cites="Sternberg1999">(<a href="#ref-Sternberg1999">1999</a>)</span>, for example, proposes that these comprise: independence of judgement, self-confidence, and attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and tolerance for ambiguity, openness to experience, psychoticism, risk taking, androgyny, perfectionism, persistence, resilience, and self-efficacy. More empirically, Heilman, Nadeau and Beversdorf <span class="citation" data-cites="Heilman2003">(<a href="#ref-Heilman2003">2003</a>)</span> have investigated the possible brain mechanisms involved in creative innovation. While a certain level of domain specific knowledge and special skills are necessary components of creativity, they point out that ‘co-activation and communication between regions of the brain that ordinarily are not strongly connected’ might be equally important. Newell, Shaw and Simon add to the above with their report on the creative thinking process <span class="citation" data-cites="Newell1963">(<a href="#ref-Newell1963">1963</a>)</span>. They identify three main conditions for creativity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the use of imagery in problem solving</p></li>
<li><p>the relation of unconventionality to creativity</p></li>
<li><p>the role of hindsight in the discovery of new heuristics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other issues they point out are abstraction and generalisation <span class="citation" data-cites="Newell1963">(<a href="#ref-Newell1963">1963</a>)</span>. So, for example, poets transform the grammar of their conceptual space (in this case, language) to create new sentence structures in a poetic form. By doing so, they go against the expectations, the possibilities of the language and cause surprise. Some people might not understand the transformations and therefore the jokes or beauty of a poem simply because they are either not able to recognise connections between the old and newly transformed elements (maybe due to a lack of knowledge in the poems topic or in that particular language) or because they do not want to accept unconventional methods.</p>

It will be seen that pataphysics succeeds in bringing into sharp relief the more generalised scientific ideas, because pataphysics positions itself as a science rather than an art. The pataphysical terms are taken from the natural sciences or philosophy, but always with an ironic twist, betraying their underlying humour. They connect quite strongly with the primary descriptors of creativity, while adding a certain layer of jouissance. Pataphysics is self-avowedly useless, but its principles have proven surprisingly useful for this project.</p>

Those rules are used to explore, combine and transform this space; providing the flexibility and freedom to find interesting results. Pataphysical algorithms, or ‘patalgorithms’ for short, implement such rules.</p>
<p>‘Pataphysicalisation’ of data is the process of applying such patalgorithms in order to produce creative search results. This pataphysicalisation process forms a central component of the system and influences all areas of the search tool. Figure <a href="#fig:8.2">8.2</a> roughly demonstrates how this might work. The index is created based on the corpus, the user’s query is pataphysicalised (represented here by a spiral) and the patadata is then passed on to the index to retrieve results which are then sent back to the user.</p>

<p>In theory the concept of patadata is derived from the idea that pataphysics is to metaphysics what metaphysics is to physics (or physics <span class="math inline">→</span> metaphysics <span class="math inline">→</span> pataphysics) and therefore patadata is to metadata what metadata is to data, that is:</p>
<p>Data <span class="math inline">→</span> metadata <span class="math inline">→</span> patadata</p>

<p>Arguably, few other textual forms will have greater impact on the way we read, receive, search, access, use and engage with the primary materials of humanities studies than the metadata structures that organize and present that knowledge in digital form.</p><span class="blockcitation" data-cites="Drucker2009">(Drucker <a href="#ref-Drucker2009">2009</a>)</span>
</blockquote>
<p>Patadata will allow us to engage with digital knowledge in a more creative way. If metadata helps us organise information semantically then patadata is for organising information pataphysically. If metadata is objective then patadata is subjective.</p>
<p>Drucker points out that “many information structures have graphical analogies and can be understood as diagrams that organise the relations of elements within the whole” <span class="citation" data-cites="Drucker2009">(<a href="#ref-Drucker2009">2009</a>)</span>. So maybe patadata could allow us to represent these graphical analogies. An alphabetical list is a typical model for representing text data sets for example. Or an otherwise ranked list, a tree structure, a matrix, a one-to-many relationship, etc. A ranked list is probably not the best way to represent search results though. Ranking itself seems unpataphysical. It contradicts the underlying philosophy, although we can argue that this contradiction in turn makes it pataphysical. Maybe this dilemma can be solved simply by adopting another type of graphical analogy to structure the results such as a tree structure instead of a ranked list.</p>
<p>Example: Let’s say our patadata is represented by a list of keywords that each stands for a pataphysicalisation of the original query term. This list is added to each item in the index.</p>

<p>
<code>Query    = </code>‘<code>Tree</code>’<br />
<code>Patadata = [Tree (equivalent),  Car (opposite), Paper (antinomy),</code><br />
<code>            Narwhal (anomaly), Book (syzygy), </code><br />
<code>            Venus Fly Trap (clinamen)]</code><br />
<br />
<code>Query    = </code>‘<code>Sun God Ra</code>’<br />
<code>Patadata = [Sun God Ra (equivalent), Slave (opposite), </code><br />
<code>            Holiday (antinomy), Blue Balloon (anomaly), </code><br />
<code>            Pyramid (syzygy), Sphinx (clinamen)]</code>

<p>In traditional web search, ranking signals contribute to the improvement of the ranking process (see chapter <a href="technology.html#s:ranking">6.1.3</a>).</p>
<p>Ranking can be done at different stages of the search process. Depending on how the index is formatted and what information can be pre-computed at that stage, a ranking algorithm evaluates every web page for relevance and returns them in order. There exist lots of different approaches on ranking, including PageRank <span class="citation" data-cites="Brin1998">(Page et al. <a href="#ref-Brin1998">1999</a>)</span> and HITS <span class="citation" data-cites="Kleinberg1999">(Kleinberg <a href="#ref-Kleinberg1999">1999</a>)</span>, which both analyse the link structure of the WWW. They analyse the incoming and outgoing links on pages. PageRank for example assigns a numerical weight to each document, where each link counts as a ‘vote of support’ in a sense. It is executed at indexing time, so the ranks are stored with each page directly in the index. HITS stands for ‘Hyperlink Induced Topic Search’ and its basic features are the use of so called hubs and authority pages. It is executed at query time. Pages that have many incoming links are called authorities and pages with many outgoing links are called hubs.</p>
<p>Given a query term <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span>, what is considered a relevant match though? Do we simply return a list of web pages where <span class="math inline"><em>q</em></span> appears in the heading of each page? It is obviously not that easy. Several ranking signals are combined together; Google states that they use over signals including PageRank and they personalise results using signals such as the web history and location <span class="citation" data-cites="Google2012">(“Google Ranking” <a href="#ref-Google2012">2012</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>The way ranking (if it can be called that) works in <a href="http://pata.physics.wtf" class="uri">pata.physics.wtf</a> is described in chapter <a href="implementation.html">10</a>.</p>
