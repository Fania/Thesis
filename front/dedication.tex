In Germany we call PhD supervisors \textit{Doktorvater} or \textit{Doktormutter}. In that tradition I would like to thank my `doctor-parents' Hongji Yang, Andrew Hugill, Jim Hendler and Sophy Smith for the many years of advice and support they have given me. 

De Montfort University generously provided me with a 3-year grant to help me survive and without it I would not have been able to write this thesis.

I would also like to thank my `real' family (Fred, Sylvia, Alena, Jannie, and Celine), my chair, my Internet provider, and the 5 little silver stones outside my house.

  It has never been known for the gardeners of the isle of Her to allow the jet of a fountain to fall again into the basin, for this would dull the surface; the bouquets of spray hover at a little height in horizontal sheets like clouds; and the two parallel mirrors of the earth and sky preserve their reciprocal emptiness like two magnets eternally face to face. \sourceatright{\autocite{Jarry1996}}

I dedicate the `Ph' of my `PhD' to my partner Dave. I will henceforth be known as Doctor Fania and he shall be called Dave of Philosophy. \textipa{["h\ae pi} \begin{CJK}{UTF8}{min}物\end{CJK} \textipa{"v3:s@ri]} <3 \textipa{[a\textsci \tipamedspace l2v \tipamedspace ju:]}. You make me happy.

Last but not least, I want to thank my wonderful computers for their usefullness and uselessness. They have always done exactly what I told them to do---and no more no less. They were a tool for channeling my creativity into \url{pata.physics.wtf} and this thesis. Thank you for 6 years of frustration, procrastination and damn good work.
