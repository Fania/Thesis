\begin{quote}
  ``It has never been known for the gardeners of the isle of Her to allow the jet of a fountain to fall again into the basin, for this would dull the surface; the bouquets of spray hover at a little height in horizontal sheets like clouds; and the two parallel mirrors of the earth and sky preserve their reciprocal epmtiness like two magnets eternally face to face.'' \citep[p.49]{Jarry1997}
